Title: More Women Asked To Join Military
Details: In response to a recruitment crisis, the UK is launching a campaign to encourage more women to join the military.UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps: “Something which I'm extremely passionate about is actually having a military which should represent our country as it is today. It can't be right that our military still only has 11 or 12% women, for example, when you make up half the population.”Women currently make up about 11.3% of Britain's military. The Royal Air Force (RAF) leads with 16% female personnel, while the Army has just 10.3%.The recruitment crisis has become so dire that military defense chiefs have ordered hundreds of soldiers to move from front-line roles and man recruitment offices to help entice more young Brits to enlist.Last week, reports emerged that the UK’s Royal Navy was forced to advertise for a top job on social media, which military sources called “utterly shameful.” The position would be responsible for “elite operations” and the nation’s nuclear deterrent.Intake for the Navy and Royal Marines dropped 22.1% compared with the previous year, while the RAF dropped by almost 17% and the Army by nearly 15%. A similar trend is occurring in the U.S., where the Army and Air Force fell short of their respective goals by around 10,000 recruits in 2023, while the Navy was under by 6,000.

Title: S. Africa Begins Israel Genocide Case
Details: South Africa has formally accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, beginning a landmark case in the UN’s top court.The African nation seeks an immediate end to Israel’s military operations, arguing that the ongoing conflict is a long-term oppression of Palestinians, leading to over 23,000 deaths in Gaza. About two-thirds of the dead in Gaza are women and children, Palestinian health officials say.Adila Hassim, South African lawyer: “Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has evidence of a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts.”Israel vehemently defends its actions, asserting the Jewish state adheres to international law and is only focused on protecting its citizens from Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists Israel's actions are not aimed at Gaza's civilians but at Hamas terrorists.

Title: AI Threatens To Crush News Companies
Details: Media companies are sounding the alarm on AI using their content as training, claiming that inevitable legal battles will be so costly and time-consuming that many news organizations will go out of business.The legality issue centers on whether AI's use of news content falls under “fair use” or constitutes copyright infringement. The tension was intensified after The New York Times sued OpenAI in December over ChatGPT’s use of their material.This week, Democrat Senator Richard Blumenthal joined several other lawmakers in supporting a framework that would clarify intellectual property laws don’t protect AI companies using copyrighted material to build their chatbots. “We need to learn from the mistakes of our failure to oversee social media and adopt standards,” he said. Others argue that AI use of the content is “fair use” and doesn’t constitute copyright infringement.Roger Lynch, CEO of Condé Nast, which owns outlets like GQ and Vogue, urged a congressional hearing on Wednesday to “clarify that the use of our content and other publications’ content for training and output of AI models is not fair use.”Republican Senator Josh Hawley agreed: “Why shouldn’t we expand the regime outward to say anyone whose data is ingested and regurgitated by generative AI—whether in name, image or likeness—has the right to compensation?”Still, it’s unlikely this issue will be solved anytime soon, leading to a slew of legal battles. “A major concern is the amount of time to litigate, appeal, go back to the courts, appeal, and maybe make it to the Supreme Court to settle,” said Lynch. “Between now and then, many media companies will go out of business.”

Title: Trump Says He Knows His VP
Details: Trump revealed that he has already chosen his running mate but won’t disclose the name.Speaking at a Fox News town hall in Iowa yesterday, the former president said, “I know who it's going to be.”Chris LaCivita, senior campaign adviser, told reporters after the town hall: “That's an issue that we really have not in any great detail discussed. I'm sure when that time comes, everybody will know who it is.”Trump's vice president in his first term, Mike Pence, challenged him in the Republican primary this year but dropped out of the race when he failed to garner significant support in Iowa and other early states.The former president is currently leading in Iowa and national polls. In a December poll, 51% of likely Republican caucusgoers named Trump as their first choice for president. DeSantis had 19% and Haley 16%, each seeking to break out as the main alternative to Trump.

By establishing a generative AI Governing Board within my administration and partnering with universities that are national leaders in developing and deploying AI, we have already leaned into innovation to ensure our Commonwealth approaches generative AI use responsibly and ethically to capitalize on opportunity.”Sam Altman, OpenAI boss: “Our collaboration... will provide valuable insights into how AI tools can responsibly enhance state services.”The pilot study tests AI's impact on productivity and security. Meanwhile, the U.S. Space Force has banned generative AI use due to security risks.

Title: ‘Tech Tantrums’ New Norm For Toddlers
Details: Scientists note that parents are having trouble managing “tech tantrums,” which stem from their children's transitions from screen time to non-digital activities. In response, researchers have offered strategies to help.These include setting clear time limits, using interests from screen content to inspire real-life activities, and offering choices to the child.Juliana Zabatiero, a research fellow at Curtin University: “Prepare children and let them know when their screen time will end.”For example, the researchers note parents can say, “When this game is finished we will stop,” or, “You can watch two episodes of this show.” Telling them which activity would follow is also helpful. For example: “When you have finished that game it will be time to eat,” or, “After you have watched that show we will go to the park.”

Title: NYC Jews Had Migrants Dig Tunnel
Details: Orthodox Jews in New York City who illegally dug a secret tunnel under a synagogue secretly hired migrants to do the manual labor “Shawshank”-style, according to the New York Post.On Monday night, chaos erupted at the Chabad-Lubavitch World Headquarters in Brooklyn when a group of young Jewish men tried to stop police and construction crews from filling in the secret tunnel. According to the synagogue, the tunnel was dug to reach a closed-down women’s bath.According to the Post, six renegade members of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement began digging the three-foot-high, 20-foot-wide, 50-foot-long tunnel themselves, using crude instruments and their hands. “You’ve seen the movie ‘The Shawshank Redemption’? That’s what these young men did at first: They dug and put the dirt in their pockets,” Eitan Kalmowitz, a Lubavitcher community member, told the Post.Ultimately, they hired migrant laborers to complete the tunnel. “The Mexicans lived in the building for three weeks during the work,” said Kalmowitz. He emphasized that the migrants did the work “correctly” and installed support beams. “They slept and ate there because it was a secret operation.”On Monday night, Jewish men were filmed tearing down wood panels and wooden support beams. Other footage showed cops trying to hold back dozens of Hasidic Jewish men toppling over wooden pews in their anger. In one video, a Jewish man is seen climbing up from the sewer.

Title: Saudi Unveils Upside-Down Skyscraper
Details: Neom, a futuristic megacity in Saudi Arabia, has unveiled its new project: an ultra-luxury, upside-down skyscraper that will be built into a mountain.Designed by LAVA and Name Architecture, the skyscraper Aquellum features an “underwater open square,” hotel, retail spaces, residential apartments, and innovative hubs.
