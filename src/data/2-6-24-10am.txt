Title: ‘Driving Under Virtual’ Now A Thing
Details: A Tesla driver filmed himself driving while wearing Apple’s Vision Pro Headset on the same day the device came out. At one point, both of his hands are off the wheel and it appears as if he has been pulled over by police, but the man claims it was a skit.Still, Apple seems to already foresee similar incidents happening, cautioning on its website: “Never use Apple Vision Pro while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety.”

Title: Path To Self-Made Wealth Is Shrinking
Details: In 2023, more wealth was accumulated through inheritance than entrepreneurship. This was the first year the Union Bank of Switzerland has found this to be the case in nine years of research.The trend reflects challenging conditions for building wealth through entrepreneurship and a widening gap in economic opportunities. The world saw 150 new billionaires in 2023, down from the 236 billionaires that were created in 2022.For perspective, 90% of children born in 1940 went on to earn more than their parents, but that rate dropped to just 50% in the 80s.Additionally, salaries in 2021 for the top 0.1% of earners grew at the fastest pace of any income group. Meanwhile, the bottom 90% saw their wages decline. The disparity is expected to grow, with a predicted transfer of $5.2 trillion from billionaire boomers to their heirs in the next 20-30 years.Economists point to higher interest rates as a root cause, which in turn have made it much more difficult to own a home. Less wealthy Americans have also been slammed by high inflation, high borrowing costs, and meager wage gains.Matthew Staiger, research scientist: “The chance of rising up and doing better than your parents went from basically [certain] for kids born in the mid-century to a coin flip in the 1980s. This is just the first part where you can really see that it's starting to gain momentum. I think there's much work to be done to try to restore rates of economic opportunity to those observed several decades ago.”

Title: News Companies Want Different Owners
Details: Layoffs across billionaire-owned news outlets have led reporters to question if extremely wealthy individuals have the best interests of journalism at heart, or if the media companies should instead become non-profits and function as a community service.For instance, at Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post, 240 jobs were cut last year, with buyouts funded by the pension fund, not Bezos. “Are you kidding me? He's sending rockets into space, he’s got a $500 million yacht. Do you have unrealistic business expectations or are you just seeing red ink?” one furious staffer remarked.Amid growing financial losses, similar cutbacks have occurred at other billionaire-owned newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times, which last month laid off 20% of its newsroom because of a “financial crisis.”All of this comes as major news websites experience major downturns in traffic, with the top ten seeing double-digit falls last year.

Title: Eurovision Pressured To Ban Israel
Details: Over 20 politicians have urged the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to exclude Israel from this year’s Eurovision Song Contest. They argue that allowing Israel to participate could whitewash its military actions, which they describe as “ethnic cleansing in Palestine” and “committing war crimes and genocide.”The call for exclusion mirrors past political actions within Eurovision, such as banning Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and imposing a fine on Iceland for displaying a Palestinian flag during the contest in Tel Aviv.Critics, including European Parliament members and members of Spain’s Podemos party, argue that Israel’s participation conflicts with the EBU’s stance on maintaining a non-political event.Public figures and Eurovision fans have expressed discontent, with many pledging to boycott the event if Israel participates. Some note that excluding Russia for its invasion of Ukraine but allowing Israel to compete represents a double standard.

Title: Gen Z Is More Insecure After COVID
Details: A new report from the dating app Hinge reveals that Gen Z daters are 47% more likely than Millennials to feel nervous talking to people due to COVID. This nervousness extends to a 25% higher likelihood of feeling less confident on first dates.Over half of the Gen Z users on Hinge admit that fear of rejection has prevented them from pursuing romantic interests. 44% also have little to no dating experience, with many avoiding direct communication and favoring memes or jokes over expressing genuine feelings or intentions.Hinge: “Even now, several years after we first heard the word COVID, the pandemic continues to impact how Gen Z socializes. Daters are tiptoeing around direct communication to avoid coming off as cringey or overeager. They’re hiding behind memes and jokes, rather than sharing genuine feelings or intentions.”

Title: Study: Best-Performing Cities In U.S.
Details: An annual report identifies Austin, Raleigh, Boise, Salt Lake City, and Provo as leading U.S. cities for economic performance. Specifically, they excel in offering high wages, job supply, a manageable cost of living, and dynamic tech sectors.The study from the Milken Institute evaluated 403 metropolitan areas using 13 metrics from 2022 to 2023. Nashville, Northwest Arkansas, Dallas, Olympia, and Charlotte also ranked highly among large metros.Notably, four Idaho cities dominated the top spots in the smaller cities category. Their success is attributed to strong job and wage growth, particularly in hi-tech sectors and economic resilience.The report suggests ongoing shifts in the distribution of job growth from traditional megacities to regions like Texas and the Sun Belt, influenced by climate change, the migration of hi-tech jobs, and remote work trends.

Title: Army Tried To Recruit On Fortnite
Details: The British Army was planning on using “Fortnite” to encourage new recruits, but their strategy was canceled after backlash. The ploy comes as the number of troops in the country’s armed forces has fallen to a record low.Reportedly, the army was going to host a Twitch live stream alongside prominent influencers to attract young recruits. One online commentator said in response: “Is your marketing department sick in the head? Do you know the demographic of Fortnite? You are recruiting CHILDREN.”Earlier this month, reports emerged that the UK was recruiting on social media for a top military position that would handle nuclear operations.Top officials have voiced serious concerns about the recruitment shortfall. Former chief of staff General Lord Dannatt said that “there is a serious danger of history repeating itself… If our armed forces are not strong enough to deter future aggression from Moscow or Beijing it will not be a small war to contend with but a major one.”

Title: Coca-Cola Not Worried About Ozempic
Details: The CEO of Coca-Cola is downplaying the impact that weight loss drugs like Ozempic have on his company.James Quincey emphasized in an interview that in almost every category, his company has products without calories and sugar. “We already have the products” to respond to shifts in behavior, he noted.“When you break down the data, I do not think it is a big thing for us,” he said. “If you want to make it super simple, we sell a range of beverages. At the end of the day, you can eat less calories. You cannot have less liquid.”As for the original sugary sweet Coke beverage, Quincey said, “I think it will continue to be a big part of the business.”Coca-Cola isn’t the first company to discuss the impact of the drugs. Walmart said last October that users of weight loss drugs are buying less food, citing anonymized data.

Title: Studios Ask Reddit For IP Addresses
Details: Film studios are trying to force Reddit to disclose the IP addresses of users who discussed illegally distributing movies on the platform, marking their third attempt in less than a year.In 2023, Reddit successfully defended two similar subpoenas, citing the First Amendment right to anonymous speech. The current dispute involves a subpoena for “IP address log information from 1/1/2017 to present” for six Reddit users, a narrower request than before.The studios argue that “the Reddit users do not have a recognized privacy interest in their IP addresses,” challenging previous court decisions. In a filing from last month, the film studios claimed that six Redditors' IP address logs are “clearly relevant and proportional to the needs of the case."Reddit responded to the studios' subpoena with a letter stating that the demand “does not satisfy the First Amendment standard for disclosure of identifying information regarding an anonymous speaker.”Last year, a Reddit user wrote that they received 44 emails from a telecommunications company threatening to cut off their service due to torrent downloads. They felt the fact that no action had been taken after 44 emails indicated that the company was all talk and no action: “If they didn’t do it after 44 emails ... they won’t.”

Title: Doctor Determined To Cure Diabetes
Details: Dr. Quinn Peterson, a director at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is dedicated to curing diabetes, a personal mission of his that was sparked by his three children being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.Originally focused on chemotherapy drugs, Peterson shifted to diabetes research: “I felt a responsibility as a father that if I could contribute in any way to being able to relieve the suffering of this disease, not only for my daughter but for all of those who are suffering with this disease, that I had the responsibility to do that.”His team is developing cell-based therapy to replace supplementary insulin, and trials have already begun for the therapy. The procedure works by placing new, healthy cells into the body to replace diseased or damaged ones.“It's been a very rewarding experience for me to be able to work on something that I have such a personal passion for,” Peterson noted. “But that passion has only gotten stronger subsequently since my children were diagnosed.”Diabetes is increasing globally and is expected to strike 1.5 billion people by 2050. A study published last year in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that obesity is linked to 30 to 53% of new diabetes cases in the U.S. per year.
