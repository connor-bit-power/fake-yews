Title: Man Loses $25M To Deepfake
Details: A finance worker in Hong Kong was deceived into transferring £20 million ($25M) to fraudsters using a deepfake video of his boss. The scam involved an elaborate setup, convincing the employee through a video call that featured AI-generated images of his colleagues.Initially hesitant due to the unusual request for a “secret transaction,” the employee’s suspicions grew during the call. Despite feeling that something was “a little off,” the presence of supposed colleagues on the call swayed his decision to proceed with the transfers.The fraud was unveiled when the employee later checked with the company’s head office, revealing that not just the boss, but everyone on the call was a deepfake.The AI-generated videos were likely created using past online conferences, with voice alterations made to match each person supposedly on the call.

Title: School Has No Grades Or Homework
Details: In Baltimore, a school offers an alternative approach to the traditional education system’s focus on grades, tests, and homework. The Arts and Ideas Sudbury School promotes self-directed learning without conventional academic pressures.The Sudbury model allows students to pursue their interests freely, with staff members helping rather than dictating learning. This approach helped one student, Jasper, explore various subjects, including cooking, through practical experiences.Students at Arts and Ideas also benefit from mixed-age interactions, gaining knowledge and skills from peers of different ages. This environment creates a sense of community and mentorship among students. To graduate, students must write and defend a thesis on their readiness for the real world.Jasper, having graduated in 2023, is now taking a gap year before college, equipped with the skills and confidence gained from his unique school. His mother believes the school provided him with a stress-free childhood focused on joy and self-discovery, focusing on the importance of personal growth over academic achievement.

Title: Youth Having Heart Attacks More
Details: Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., but there’s been a concerning rise in heart attacks among younger adults aged 20 to 50.Several lifestyle choices, often established in childhood, contribute to this increase, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and the use of substances.COVID has also played a role in exacerbating heart disease, particularly through its inflammatory effects on the body, which can lead to blood clots and heart attacks. This has been especially noted in the age group of 25 to 44.The American Heart Association emphasizes prevention with “Life’s Essential 8”: a healthy diet, no tobacco, regular exercise, sufficient sleep, weight management, monitoring cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Regular check-ins with a healthcare provider are recommended to manage these risk factors effectively.

Title: Water Engineered From Thin Air
Details: Amid severe droughts in Las Vegas, innovative technology is turning air into drinking water using solar-powered hydropanels. This modern technique is rooted in ancient practices, such as fog nets in Peru, dating back to the 1500s.Cody Friesen, an associate professor at Arizona State University, founded Source Global, creating hydropanels that absorb water vapor from the air when exposed to sunlight, even in extremely dry conditions like Scottsdale, Arizona. These panels are cost-effective and efficient, designed to produce four to five liters of water per panel per day, with the potential to increase output with advancements in AI and machine learning.Source Global’s mission extends beyond profit, aiming to democratize water access for communities without reliable sources, including rural and tribal areas and regions struck by natural disasters.The technology, which has reached over 50 countries, could be a sustainable solution to global water scarcity, potentially even for future missions to Mars.

Title: Big Bank: STEM Is Worthless
Details: The chief economist at the world’s largest private bank, UBS, has published an analysis warning that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) skills, such as computer coding, will become obsolete thanks to AI.Economist Paul Donovan writes that STEM is a “stranded asset,” meaning it will lose “its value earlier than expected, normally because of changing economic structures. The fourth industrial revolution is already turning previously secure investments into liabilities.”He goes on to argue: “STEM skills have traditionally become obsolete more quickly than other skills. It is easier for technology to replace the absolute skills of STEM than other more abstract subjects. Much of computer coding already has the look of a stranded asset, and other STEM skills may follow.”Donovan doesn’t elaborate further, but he does offer some advice: “Education needs to offer flexibility, and less scientific subjects (including, of course, economics) may be more important in creating future economic success.”

Title: Shein Under Fire For Toddler Clothes
Details: Shein is being criticized for selling “sexy” clothes and padded bikinis for children as young as six months.The Chinese fast fashion retailer, known for its incredibly cheap prices and vast global shipping reach, features items like a $10 teal velvet dress and a $7 figure-hugging sequin dress in its children’s range. One parent online noted that a review for the children's clothing called it “sexy and cute.”The brand’s marketing of padded bikinis to the same age group, along with adult-like designs and accessories, has further fueled the controversy. “Disbelief parents are actually buying this for their kids,” one mother wrote.

Title: Canada Bans Foreigners From Housing
Details: Canada is extending its ban on foreign nationals and commercial enterprises from purchasing residential property until 2027, aiming to make homes more accessible for Canadian families.The original ban, established in 2022, includes exceptions for international students, refugee claimants, and temporary workers. This measure targets preserving housing affordability amid a severe national crisis.Experts debate its effectiveness on housing affordability, citing the small market share owned by non-Canadians. Critics argue the ban is more political than an effective housing strategy.Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland: “By extending the foreign buyer ban, we will ensure houses are used as homes for Canadian families to live in and do not become a speculative financial asset class.”

Title: New Work-Life: Don’t Have Kids
Details: Among graduates from Wharton Business School, one of the top MBA schools in the U.S., interest in becoming parents has dropped from 78% in 1992 to 42% in 2012. The stark trend comes as Milennials increasingly prioritize career over family life and the U.S. birth rate has fallen by 20% since 2012.Young adults attribute their disinterest in having children to inflexible jobs, high daycare costs, and the challenge of finding a spouse willing to share household responsibilities. Financial concerns also seem to play a significant role, apparent in the rising costs of living, healthcare, and education. To many prospective parents, the idea of saving at least $300 a month for a child’s college from birth appears daunting.Earlier this month, a poll of 7,000 adults in the UK found that only 19% of younger Millennials expressed a definitive desire to have children, while 30% leaned toward probably wanting children.
