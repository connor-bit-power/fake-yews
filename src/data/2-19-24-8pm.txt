Title: Elon Wants 1 Million People On Mars
Details: Elon Musk says he is developing a “game plan” to transport one million people to Mars. He’s aiming for the first manned mission by 2029, though it was originally planned for this year.Musk wrote on X: “We are mapping out a game plan to get a million people to Mars. Civilization only passes the single-planet Great Filter when Mars can survive even if Earth supply ships stop coming. We don’t want to be one of those single-planet species, we want to be a multi-planet species.”He continued: “It’s been now almost half a century since humans were last on the moon. That’s too long, we need to get back there and have a permanent base on the moon - again, like a big permanently occupied base on the moon. And then build a city on Mars to become a spacefaring civilization, a multi-planet species.”

Title: Mountain Goats Are Turning Nocturnal
Details: Climate change is pushing mountain goats, specifically ones found in European mountains, to adopt a more nocturnal lifestyle.Researchers tracked the goats using GPS collars between 2006 and 2019, noting increased nighttime activity during hotter days, even in areas with more predators. This shift suggests goats prioritize avoiding heat over avoiding predators, impacting their foraging efficiency and possibly their fitness and population dynamics.Scientists are raising concerns about this shift as the animals are adapted to daytime activity, meaning nocturnal behavior is abnormal. This could have far-reaching implications on the food chain, especially if more animals undergo similar transformations.

Title: Putin Has Found His Barbie
Details: Putin, aged 71, reportedly has a secret relationship with a woman who resembles a Barbie. Named Ekaterina Mizulina, she’s a 39-year-old internet safety chief.Mizulina graduated from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London in 2004, has an art history degree, and is the daughter of a pro-Putin senator. She previously served as a translator in official Russian delegations to China.Putin has been secretive about his personal life but is rumored to have two secret children with Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva. The Kremlin has denied she is his secret First Lady, but rumors have persisted, including claims she gave birth to at least one child.Russian human rights campaigner: “Katya Mizulina is to Putin’s taste. This Barbie type has always suited him very well.”

Title: Gen Z Treats Employers Like Bad Dates
Details: A striking 93% of Gen Z workers have ghosted employers by skipping interviews or the first work day, with 87% backing out after job offer acceptance. According to Indeed’s survey, it makes the youth “feel in charge of their career.”This behavior has made hiring significantly harder for businesses. For instance, an MIT interviewer and finance CEO was so fed up with young candidates not showing up for their interviews that she ranted about it on X.“One no-showed after picking the time on my calendar,” Christina Qi wrote. “Look, I know college isn’t for everyone, but this 1 meeting could affect where you go for these next 4 years of your life.”The UK head of talent intelligence at Indeed said that “it’s clear that the financial offer is the biggest carrot for employers trying to attract talent, with pay, benefits, and other factors that support the rise in cost-of-living likely to prevent a jobseeker from ghosting.”

Title: Nikki Haley Posts Sus Tweet
Details: On a calm Sunday afternoon, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley posted on X: “12 fellas down. 1 to go.” It’s safe to assume she was referring to the dwindling GOP presidential field, but most people interpreted it differently.One user responded: “Husband out of town again?”Another asked: “You ever get the feeling that Haley’s staff hates her?”And another: “That’s a lot of fellas.”Later that same day, 26 posts were scheduled in less than 40 minutes.

Title: AI Can Tell If You’re Male Or Female
Details: Stanford scientists have engineered an AI that can tell if someone is male or female purely based on their brain scans. Remarkably, the AI has a 90% accuracy, demonstrating that sex has identifiable neurological traits and that AI is incredibly good at identifying these traits.The creation of the AI stems from the need to understand how sex influences the human brain’s structural and functional aspects. Despite knowing that sex chromosomes influence hormone exposure, connecting sex to concrete brain differences had previously been challenging.Director of the Stanford Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience Laboratory: “A key motivation for this study is that sex plays a crucial role in human brain development, in aging, and in the manifestation of psychiatric and neurological disorders. A researcher could use our models to look for brain differences linked to learning impairments or social functioning differences, for instance—aspects we are keen to understand better to aid individuals in adapting to and surmounting these challenges.”

Title: African Leaders Under Fire For Flying
Details: Two presidents of African nations are facing criticism for their frequent international travels despite economic challenges at home. Kenyan President William Ruto and Nigerian President Bola Tinubu have been described by citizens as the “flying presidents.”One Kenyan newspaper wrote of Ruto: “So great is his love for flying that it appears that he cannot pass up any opportunity,” referring to pressing domestic demands, such as dealing with the high cost of living. Ruto has made about 50 trips abroad since 2022.Nigeria’s Tinubu has made 14 trips since his inauguration eight months ago and has reportedly spent 36% more than the budgeted amount for travel in six months.Critics argue both leader’s trips are unnecessary, with Ruto spending over $9.2 million and Tinubu $2.2 million in travel expenses.

Title: 18 Kids Hospitalized After Experiment
Details: In Tennessee, 18 third graders were hospitalized after being exposed to carbon dioxide poisoning during a dry ice experiment.The experiment took place last week and caused concern for a “mass casualty incident,” prompting a large-scale response from first responders, including the fire department and police. Beyond the initial 18 students, another 20 who were present for the experiment were assessed by paramedics.A parent of an affected student: “The most information I have gotten at this point is out of a nine-year-old that is not feeling well. Not out of a doctor, not out of a representative from the school, nothing.”

Title: Walmart Ice Cream Doesn’t Melt
Details: Social media users have noticed that Walmart’s Great Value ice cream sandwiches don’t melt, even in 80-degree heat. This has caused concern, with one mother showing on TikTok that the ice cream doesn’t melt after four hours, turning yellow instead.To clear things up, Walmart officially stated that “ice cream melts based on the ingredients including cream. Ice cream with more cream will generally melt at a slower rate, which is the case with our Great Value ice cream sandwiches.”It’s been documented that manufacturers add gums and other ingredients like calcium sulfate to help control the melting rate of ice cream. Although the FDA says these ingredients are safe, the phenomenon has sparked debate on food chemistry and consumer expectations of natural food behavior.One user noted, “This reminds me of a room-safe ‘ice cream’ you can find in hospitals, nursing homes and disability accommodation sometimes.”
