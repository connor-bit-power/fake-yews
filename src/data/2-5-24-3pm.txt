Title: MIT: 15-Minute-Cities Can Liberate
Details: In a new study, MIT researchers explore the feasibility of a 15-minute city model in America, analyzing phone data from 40 million Americans to understand neighborhood usage patterns.The 15-minute city concept envisions mixed-use neighborhoods where essential services are within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Supporters of the concept say it could create more sustainable, livable urban environments by reducing reliance on automobiles, lowering emissions, and improving quality of life.The study reveals that the median American makes only 14% of their essential trips within a 15-minute walk. Some regions vary, with Northeastern cities like New York showing higher walkability (42% of trips within a 15-minute radius) compared to rapidly growing, car-centric cities like Atlanta (10%).Despite historical zoning and planning focused on car travel, Americans show a natural preference for the convenience of nearby amenities.

Title: Cryogenic Lab Wants To ‘Defeat Death’
Details: Dennis Kowalski, President of the Cryonics Institute in Michigan, defends cryonics as a viable option for those seeking life after death. He has already frozen over 100 bodies and 125 pets, hoping for future revival.Critics argue cryonics offers “false hope,” while Kowalski believes it’s a fight against death, offering a chance, however slim, for resurrection. The process involves preserving bodies at -196˚C in liquid nitrogen.The institute, founded in 1976, charges over $28,000 for body preservation and has become the world’s largest cryogenics lab.Kowalski admits there’s a chance that revived individuals might return as “zombie-like clones,” but emphasizes the importance of attempting revival as opposed to accepting death.The practice has sparked debate over ethics and the regulation of the cryonics industry, especially after a case involving a 13-year-old British girl who wished to be cryo-preserved.

Title: Study: Happiness Not Tied To Wealth
Details: A study from Spain highlights that happiness doesn’t solely depend on wealth, as many indigenous and local communities show high life satisfaction despite minimal financial resources. This challenges the common belief that higher income leads to greater happiness.Researchers surveyed nearly 3,000 people across 19 Indigenous communities worldwide, finding an average life satisfaction score of 6.8 out of 10.Despite low monetary incomes, with 64% of households reporting any cash income, these communities still have levels of happiness similar to those in wealthier nations.This study suggests that contentment may stem more from our social ties and connection to nature. It reveals that while individual income does contribute to happiness, it accounts for only a small variation in life satisfaction.Researcher: “The strong correlation frequently observed between income and life satisfaction is not universal and proves that wealth – as generated by industrialized economies – is not fundamentally required for humans to lead happy lives.”
