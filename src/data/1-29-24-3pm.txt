Title: Epstein Lover Writing Memoir In Jail
Details: Ghislaine Maxwell is reportedly “obsessively working on” a memoir while serving a 20-year sentence at FCI Tallahassee, Florida. This memoir aims to address what she perceives as misinformation about her connection with Jeffrey Epstein.62-year-old Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking minors, denies wrongdoing and intends her book to prove her innocence. She asserts newly released court documents, which name Epstein’s associates and detail his crimes, contain misinformation.She has been working on this book obsessively, using a typewriter, as she has no computer access in prison. Maxwell is legally allowed to write a private manuscript and send it to a lawyer or loved one for distribution.The book, which she claims is already finished, is being kept under tight security by Maxwell, who fears theft or leaks. She has become increasingly withdrawn and bitter, reflecting her challenging prison experience.An insider: “Max says the documents in the news are all false or misinformation. The truth will only come out when her book does. She’s bragging about how great it will be but it sounds like the same old lies she has told a thousand times. She really thinks she hasn’t done anything wrong and that her charges will be dropped when people read it.”

Title: Study: Humans Spread Alzheimer’s
Details: A groundbreaking study has found evidence of Alzheimer’s disease transmission in humans. At least five individuals developed a rare early-onset form of dementia after receiving growth hormone treatments contaminated with amyloid-beta protein “seeds.”These patients were part of 1,848 individuals treated with hormones harvested from cadavers between 1958 and 1985 in the UK and the U.S. The treatment was later banned due to contamination risks.Alzheimer's disease is linked to the accumulation of protein plaques in the brain. The study suggests potential transmission risks in other medical procedures and raises concerns about sterilization methods in hospitals.Professor John Collinge, University College London: “These patients were given a specific and long-discontinued medical treatment which involved injecting them with material now known to have been contaminated with disease-related proteins.”

Title: Missouri Wants To Bring Back Duels
Details: A Missouri state senator proposed reinstating a practice used by America’s founding fathers to settle disputes as tensions flare in the statehouse: duels.“If a senator’s honor is impugned by another senator to the point that it is beyond repair and in order for the offended senator to gain satisfaction, such senator may rectify the perceived insult to the senator’s honor by challenging the offending senator to a duel,” states the proposal which was written by state Sen Nick Schroer.“The trusted representative, known as the second, of the offended senator shall send a written challenge to the offending senator. The two senators shall agree to the terms of the duel, including choice of weapons, which shall be witnessed and enforced by their respective seconds.”“The duel shall take place in the well of the senate at the hour of high noon on the date agreed to by the parties to the duel.”Mr Schroer’s chief of staff, Jamey Murphy, told Newsweek that the state senator is “deeply committed to restoring a sense of honor in the Missouri Senate.”

Title: TSA: Don’t Worry About Face ID

Images are reportedly deleted after a positive ID match.Senators John Kennedy and Jeff Merkley have proposed legislation to ban TSA’s use of facial recognition and repeal its testing authority.Senator John Kennedy, R-La.: “It’s astonishing that the TSA is expanding its invasive facial recognition program in the face of congressional concern.”

Title: Power Naps Are Great For Health
Details: One study found a strong causal relationship between habitual daytime napping and larger brain volume. This research analyzed data from 35,000 individuals aged 40 to 69. The study suggests that napping several times a week might delay brain aging by three to six years.Short naps of 5 to 15 minutes can immediately improve mental performance, lasting up to three hours post-nap.Researcher: “The big finding was that daytime napping is, quite robustly, causally linked to having a larger brain volume. People who have a smaller brain volume are more likely to have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, or a diagnosis of sleep apnea… many have cardiovascular disease. We also see substantial shrinkage of the brain in [people with] Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.”Experts advise that naps shouldn't replace a good night's sleep but can be beneficial, especially for those struggling with sufficient nighttime rest.
