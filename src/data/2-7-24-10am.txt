Title: Kids Reject ‘Mindless Consumption’
Details: A new study by Paramount reveals that Gen Alpha, those under age 12, favor “purposeful participation” rather than their parents’ “mindless consumption.” In other words, they place higher value on having control, agency, and intentionality in their experiences with media.These extreme digital natives typically receive their first smartphone by age nine and demonstrate a creative “lean forward” impulse, particularly evident in their gaming preferences. The study found that unlike Gen Z, which gravitates toward collaboration, cooperation, and competition game experiences like “Fortnite,” Alpha kids prefer immersive, creative, and building-based game environments, such as “Roblox” and “Minecraft.”Additionally, kids under 12 appear to be more aware of privacy concerns than other generations, being much more likely to request their parents ask their permission before recording them or posting content that features them. Still, 69% of Alpha’s parents are anxious about the role AI could play in their kids’ lives.

Title: Apple Working On Foldable Phones
Details: Apple is reportedly developing at least two prototypes of foldable iPhones, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip. Challenges in durability and design have slowed progress, delaying any release until after 2025.According to sources, Apple engineers hope to create foldables as thin as current iPhones, though battery and display components present hurdles. Work has also progressed on a foldable iPad, expected to be around the size of an iPad Mini with efforts to minimize the display crease and perfect a flat-lying hinge. A potential release for the folding iPad could be targeted for 2026 or 2027.

Title: U.S. Replaces China With Mexico
Details: For the first time in 20 years, Mexico has surpassed China as America’s top source of official imports.The trade deficit with China has narrowed as American businesses and consumers turned to other countries for goods like auto parts, shoes, and toys. Last year, imports from China dropped 20% to $427.2 billion. Factors of this shift include trade tensions, tariffs maintained by both the Trump and Biden administrations, and companies diversifying their manufacturing to avoid geopolitical risks.Companies are also moving manufacturing from China to countries with stable trade relations with the U.S., like Mexico. For instance, Hisuin, a Chinese ATV producer, invested $152 million in a manufacturing site in Mexico.Brad Setser, economist and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations: “The world couldn’t get access to enough Chinese goods in ’21, and it gorged on Chinese goods in ’22.”

Title: Floating In A Tank Awakens Senses
Details: People are increasingly turning to “float therapy,” which offers a unique way to relax by floating in a soundproof, lightproof tank. This practice, originating from the 1950s, aims to alleviate stress and muscle pain and enhance meditation.The concept was developed by neuroscientist John C. Lilly for his psychedelic experiences. It gained commercial popularity in the 1970s, offering people a way to escape the noise and distraction of modern life.Proponents of float therapy, including NBA star Stephen Curry, attest to its benefits in providing a space for introspection and mental relaxation. Curry described it as an hour spent with his thoughts, likening it to “Russian roulette of the mind.”Research suggests floating can significantly reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and even assist individuals with PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, and anorexia nervosa. These effects can last up to 48 hours post-float.Physiological responses to floating include a drop in blood pressure and slower breathing, which contribute to relaxation. Mentally, it can slow brainwaves to a state similar to deep sleep, providing a profound sense of peace.

Interestingly, over 20% of women did not feel like having physical contact with their husbands after having a baby, while 8% no longer saw them as a sexual partner but as “family.”This phenomenon contributes to broader societal concerns, including Japan’s rapidly aging population and shrinking birth rate, raising questions about the future societal and economic impact.
