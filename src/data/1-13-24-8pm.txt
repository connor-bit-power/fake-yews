Title: Big Water: Drinking Plastic Is Fine
Details: This week, scientists released new research that found bottled water is contaminated with up to 100 times more plastic than originally thought. Specifically, there are roughly 240,000 tiny plastic particles per liter. The bottled water industry is now saying no one should be afraid.The International Bottled Water Association wrote in a statement: “Media reports about these particles in drinking water do nothing more than unnecessarily scare consumers. There currently is both a lack of standardized methods and no scientific consensus on the potential health impacts of nano- and microplastic particles.”Many scientists, such as Columbia University’s Beizhan Yan, disagree. The tiny plastic particles “can cross into the blood, and then can cross the different barriers to get into the cells,” Yan said, which could cause them to “malfunction.”Sherri Mason, director of sustainability at Penn State Behrend, took it a step further: “The chemicals can be carried to your liver and your kidney and your brain and even make their way across the placental boundary and end up in an unborn child.”

Title: Trump Leads In Iowa Caucus Poll
Details: Nikki Haley has overtaken Ron DeSantis in Iowa just before a crucial Republican caucus, according to an NBC poll. She now stands in second place behind Trump, who remains the front-runner with 48% support among likely Republican caucusgoers, a slight dip from 51% in December.Historically, the Iowa Caucus, which will happen on Monday, has provided an early sign as to who will clinch the presidential nomination. In 2016, that trend was broken when Ted Cruz won, even though Trump would go on to be the Republican nominee.Haley's rise in the polls marks her best showing with 20%, a 4% increase since December. DeSantis, meanwhile, has slipped to third place with 16%. Vivek Ramaswamy is in fourth place at 8%, up from 5% in December.

Title: DeSantis Gifted Participation Trophy
Details: After a Ron DeSantis town hall in Iowa, a man approached the Republican presidential candidate and presented him with a “participation trophy.”The man walked up in front of the cameras toward DeSantis while carrying an award and said: “Governor DeSantis I want to present to you this participation trophy.”“Now you’re probably not going to win the election but we’re proud of you for trying,” the man continued before DeSantis interjected, “I don’t do participation trophies, sorry buddy.”The man responded, “He’s special, he’s unique, and he’s our little snowflake.” Members of DeSantis’ security then quickly ushered the man away from the cameras out of the event.

Title: Washer Machine Uses Gigabytes Of Data
Details: A man was stunned when he saw his smart LG washing machine was consuming 3.7GB of data a day. Hoping to find answers, he obtained a chart from his internet router interface of the machine’s data usage and posted it on social media, quickly going viral.The owner, Johnie, said he ultimately blocked the device from his router because he was concerned it was hacked.Many users were baffled as to why Johnie voluntarily connected his washing machine to the internet. “Imagine voluntarily connecting your washing machine to the internet. Imagine yourwashing machinesaying 'connect me to your WiFi' and you just... do it, like this guy. It's like some kind of mental compulsion to obey commands from a screen or instruction manual,” one user wrote.

Title: Woman Alleges Rape In Metaverse
Details: A woman told the Daily Mail that she experienced a “virtual gang rape” in a Metaverse game, emphasizing that the trauma was similar to a real-world assault.Nina Patel said the “distressing experience” happened just 60 seconds after joining the Metaverse, and that she fears her four male attackers may have felt “disinhibited” due to being in a virtual world.Patel: “They relentlessly harassed me and then proceeded [with] the sexual assault of my avatar. Their behavior was offensive and disturbing. The attack likely occurred in that instance because of the anonymity and perceived lack of consequences within the VR space. Some people may engage in such offensive behaviors in VR settings because they feel detached from their real-world identities and believe they can act without facing any repercussions. Another issue potentially is that on some VR platforms, aggressive and violent behavior is encouraged and rewarded. The emotional and psychological impact of VR can be very genuine and impactful.”

Title: First Magic Mushroom School Opens
Details: Oregon has launched a groundbreaking psilocybin (magic mushroom) program, allowing supervised use of the psychedelic for adults 21 and over.InnerTrek is the first government-recognized licensed and operating training program in the world, according to staff. After the students complete the training, they can go on to apply for their licenses with the state.The program attracts diverse students, including midwives, educators, and retirees. The curriculum covers the history, and pharmacology of psilocybin, along with the ethics and safety of drug use. The students, once licensed, could support people at Oregon’s 19 service centers during their psychedelic experiences.InnerTrek was founded by the original proponents of the ballot measure, Measure 109, which legalized supervised psilocybin use in Oregon. All facilitator schools must have their curriculum approved by the state.Research has shown that supervised use of the drug can be an effective tool in alleviating symptoms of depression, PTSD, and other conditions.Tom Eckert, the school’s founder and an architect of Measure 109: “The facilitator community is the heart of this statewide program. This school is partly about knowledge and information, but it’s also about personal growth and defining this role in the culture through collective self-awareness and connection.”

Title: Israeli Arrested For Criticizing War
Details: A history teacher in Jerusalem was charged with intent to commit treason and held in solitary confinement due to his Facebook posts criticizing the Israeli military and mourning civilians killed in Gaza.The day after the Hamas attack on Israel, Meir Baruchin posted: “Horrific images are pouring in from Gaza. Entire families were wiped out. I don’t usually upload pictures like this, but look what we do in revenge,” attaching a picture of a dead Palestinian family that was killed in an airstrike. “Anyone who thinks this is justified because of what happened yesterday, should unfriend themselves. I ask everyone else to do everything possible to stop this madness. Stop it now. Not later, Now!!!”Ten days after that Facebook message, Baruchin was fired from his teaching job. Less than a month later, he was in a high-security jail, detained to give police more time to investigate his views.Baruchin was initially told to come to a police station for questioning over charges of sedition. When he pointed out to police that they needed a warrant from the attorney general to charge an Israeli citizen with that offense, treason charges were drawn up.When he arrived at the police station, his arms and ankles were cuffed, and he was shown a warrant to search his home. Five detectives escorted him there, turned his apartment upside down, and eventually confiscated two laptops and six hard drives.“I wasn’t allowed to take anything with me to the cell,” he says. “I walked in with my clothes on and stayed with the same clothes for four days. There were cold-water showers, a tiny piece of soap, two blankets stinking from cigarette smoke, and a tiny towel.”Baruchin told the British newspaper Observer that he had received hundreds of private messages of support from fellow teachers and students who were too frightened to go public.

Title: White House Evacuated Amid Protest
Details: Thousands of pro-Palestine supporters protested at the White House tonight, demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Many expressed their anger and frustration by shaking the security fence and throwing bloodied dolls, leading to some staff members being “relocated,” the U.S. Secret Service told Fox News.This event marked 100 days since the Hamas attack on October 7, which led to extensive retaliatory strikes by Israel. The Israeli response has reportedly resulted in over 23,800 deaths in Gaza.Protesters voiced criticisms of Biden's support for Israel, with signs reading, “No votes for Genocide Joe” and “Biden has blood on his hands.” The event occurred alongside global protests in cities like London, Paris, and Johannesburg.

Title: Bay Area Stores Lock Up Underwear
Details: Various stores in the Bay Area, including Target and Walmart, have started locking up items like underwear and socks due to increasing retail theft.Shoppers are finding it inconvenient and unusual to see everyday items under lock and key. The process of purchasing these locked-up items can be time-consuming, requiring assistance from store staff to access them. One man reported having to wait ten minutes to open up the case so he could buy some boxers.Target said it is working to prevent theft, noting in a statement that “on a limited basis, we employ theft deterrent merchandising strategies, such as locking cases, for categories that are prone to theft.”Some officials fear more stores will shut down, finding the anti-theft measures too costly and inefficient. “The cost will go up as residents will have to pay more of they'll have to commute and travel farther to pick up their groceries, to pick up their socks, to pick up their prescriptions. It's really going to be hurting our community,” said Richmond City Councilmember Cesar Cepeda.

Title: Green Spaces Linked To Stronger Bones
Details: A first-of-its-kind study found that children living near more green spaces have significantly stronger bones.By using ultrasound to measure bone density, scientists discovered that the children living in places with 20-25% more natural areas had increased bone strength equivalent to half a year’s natural growth. The likelihood of very low bone density in these children is about 65% lower.The benefits of green spaces, particularly those with trees, are attributed to higher levels of physical activity among children, which promotes bone growth. These spaces are more attractive and encourage children to spend more time outdoors.Tim Nawrot, a professor at Hasselt University in Belgium: “The stronger the bone mass is during childhood, the more capacity you have for later in life. So the real public health message from this study is that urban planners can make stronger bones of children, and that has long-lasting consequences.”
