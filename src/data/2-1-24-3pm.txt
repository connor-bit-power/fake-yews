Title: UK Using Robocops To Protect Nukes
Details: The UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority aims to introduce an AI-powered “robocop” force equipped with paint bombs and smoke guns for nuclear site security.With a £1.5 million ($1.9M) investment, the NDA seeks initial designs for a robotic defense system to enhance security while reducing labor costs at high-security sites like Sellafield and Dounreay.The proposed “roboforce” would reduce the reliance on the nearly 1,600-strong Civil Nuclear Constabulary, whose cost bill rose to £130 million ($165M) in 2022 and 2023.Innovations may include drones or vehicles deploying non-lethal deterrents like white noise and paint bombs, complemented by 360-degree cameras with facial recognition technology.The procurement document said: “The NDA covers 17 nuclear sites, 1,000 hectares of land, and over 800 buildings. We are interested in innovative ways to ensure our sites remain safe and secure in a resource-constrained environment.”A spokesman for the NDA claimed that police officers will be able to control the technology without being exposed to danger: “They will be able to override the system, or investigate and deal with intruders from a control room.”
