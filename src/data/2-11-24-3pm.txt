Details: Patrick S. Tomlinson, a science fiction author based in Milwaukee, has faced 47 swatting incidents over four years, part of a targeted harassment campaign.Tomlinson came to the attention of a hardcore group of online stalkers five and a half years ago after posting an innocuous tweet about the late “Saturday Night Live” comedian Norm Macdonald.“Hot take: I’ve never found Norm Macdonald funny and was pretty sure all my comedy friends who did were either nuts or screwing with me,” he posted on 11 September 2018.Alan Winston Filion, 17, allegedly ran a “swatting” service offering illegal hoax threats, including bomb threats and mass shootings, targeting various public figures and institutions. Tomlinson was among those repeatedly targeted.Tomlinson has described the harassment as an obsession by “sociopathic” stalkers, leading to numerous dangerous encounters with law enforcement at his home, including being handcuffed and having guns pointed at him.Despite Filion's arrest, a new Telegram channel named “Torswats Return” surfaced, indicating the continuation of the swatting service and specifically offering swats against Tomlinson for free.The harassment campaign against Tomlinson has included death threats, impersonation, and derogatory online posts, severely impacting his life and safety.Patrick S.

Title: Drug Cartels Are Targeting Montana
Details: A former DEA agent with extensive experience combating Mexican cartels, was transferred to Montana, uncovering a significant meth and fentanyl problem fueled by cartel activity.Mexican cartels have exploited Montana's “last best place,” shifting from locally made meth to imported super potent meth and fentanyl, targeting remote and indigenous communities for higher profits.Fentanyl’s low production cost and high selling price in Montana have attracted the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, with counterfeit pills made for less than 25 cents in Mexico selling for up to $100 in Montana.Cartel operations have grown bolder over the years, with associates targeting vulnerable individuals on reservations to establish drug distribution networks, severely impacting Montana’s indigenous populations.The crisis is amplified by limited law enforcement resources on reservations, sovereignty issues, and the challenge of policing a vast, rugged terrain, making it difficult to combat the drug epidemic effectively.

Title: Gen Z Glorifies Unemployment
Details: A new trend has emerged where individuals are openly sharing their experiences of being laid off on social media. Their candor marks a stark change from the shame and silence that used to accompany unemployment.While some have criticized such workers as being naive to the realities of the job market, experts say the impulse to share is helping young workers process a painful aspect of working life.One notable instance involved an account executive at Cloudflare who captured her layoff conversation with HR on TikTok. The 9-minute video reveals Brittany Pietsch’s call with representatives from human resources, whom she’d never met before. Pietsch grew frustrated as she was told she did not meet performance expectations, saying she’d gotten strong reviews from her manager and pressing for an explanation as to why she has been let go.

Title: Voldemort Actor: Audiences Too Soft
Details: Ralph Fiennes, the acclaimed actor known for roles in “Harry Potter” and “In Bruges,” has voiced his opinion against the use of trigger warnings in theatre, arguing they make audiences “soft.”Fiennes: “There are very disturbing scenes in Macbeth, terrible murders and things, but I think the impact of theatre is that you should be shocked and you should be disturbed. I don't think you should be prepared for these things and when I was young we never had trigger warnings before a show.”He continued: “Shakespeare’s plays are full of murder and full of horror, and as a young student and lover of the threatre I never experienced trigger warnings like oh by the way in King Lea Gloucester’s going to have his eyes pulled out. Theatre needs to be alive and in the present. It’s the shock, it’s the unexpected, that's what makes the theatre so exciting.”

Title: U.S. Is Producing 1 Billion Less Beef
Details: The U.S. is facing a significant decrease in its cattle population, reaching the lowest numbers seen since the 1970s, with beef cattle inventory at 28.2 million. This has resulted in a billion pounds less beef produced compared to the previous year, causing concern among farmers and industry stakeholders.Factors contributing to the decline include persistent drought conditions over the past three years, high input costs, and inflation, putting pressure on both consumers and farmers.Despite these challenges, the demand for beef has remained strong, particularly since COVID, with more people grilling at home. This strong demand, combined with reduced supply, is expected to lead to higher beef prices in the coming years.Concerns are also rising about the potential risk of disease that could further harm the cattle industry, with calls for more support and attention from the administration to address what is described as a national crisis for America’s cattlemen.

The heads of these newly discovered species were described by researchers as resembling characters from Star Wars.These findings were made by the University of the Sunshine Coast, with specimens now housed at the Natural History Museum at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.Andy Marshall, USC Professor: “We record millipedes of all sizes during our fieldwork to measure forest recovery because they are great indicators of forest health, but we didn’t realise the significance of these species until the myriapodologists had assessed our specimens.”
