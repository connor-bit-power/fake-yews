Title: San Francisco Plunges Into Civil War
Details: Silicon Valley’s leaders are stepping into San Francisco politics, aiming to address issues like crime, drug abuse, and homelessness by supporting local candidates and city ballot initiatives. They’re hosting fundraising events and using their influence to pit moderate Democrats against progressives in upcoming elections.Tech-backed efforts have already seen success, including the recall of the district attorney and some school board members, criticized for their handling of crime and education policies. This push for change stems from a belief that San Francisco’s current leadership leans too far left, impacting the city’s safety and livability.The industry’s focus is on electing a less liberal group of candidates to San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors. The board plays a crucial role in the city’s governance, with the ability to control the budget and influence policy decisions. Mayor London Breed, supported by the tech sector, often faces opposition from the board.Critics, including Dean Preston, a member of the Board of Supervisors up for re-election, argue that the tech sector’s political activism is self-serving, aiming to reshape the city’s policies for their own economic benefit.

His interviews with high-profile guests, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have contributed to this growth.The move to digital gives Morgan more flexibility in content creation, free from the constraints of traditional TV formats and regulatory oversight by bodies like Ofcom in the UK. He views the shift as an opportunity to reach a broader audience and generate higher revenue, especially from U.S. viewers.Piers Morgan: “The frustration for me has been continuing to create a TV-format show when that’s not how 95% of my audience is watching it. I’ve gotten to know very well The Daily Wire, and how lucrative that business has become. I don’t see any reason why I couldn’t expand the Uncensored brand globally.”

Title: Surgery Robot Burns Hole In Organs
Details: A man is suing Intuitive Surgical (IS), claiming a surgical robot used in a procedure to treat his wife’s colon cancer burned a hole in her organs, leading to her death.The lawsuit alleges that during a September 2021 operation at Baptist Health Boca Raton Regional Hospital, the da Vinci surgical robot caused damage to Sandra Sultzer’s small intestine, necessitating further medical intervention.Despite additional treatments, Sandra experienced ongoing abdominal pain and fever until her death in February 2022, which the lawsuit directly attributes to complications from the robotic surgery.The Sultzer lawsuit accuses IS of knowing about insulation issues with the da Vinci robot that could lead to burns on internal organs, a risk reportedly identified by the FDA between 2009 and 2011 but not disclosed to patients or the public.IS faces accusations of selling the surgical robots to hospitals inexperienced with robotic surgery and inadequately training surgeons, alongside claims of underreporting injuries and defects associated with the device to the FDA.

Title: Prosthetic Hand Can Feel Temperature
Details: Scientists have engineered the first prosthetic hand that allows wearers to feel temperature changes, enhancing the connection between amputees and their environments.MiniTouch, developed by teams from Italy and Switzerland, uses sensors to transmit thermal feedback from the prosthetic’s fingertips to the wearer, allowing for the detection of hot and cold objects with precision.Clinical trials in Bologna, Italy, demonstrated the MiniTouch’s accuracy in temperature perception, with plans to further develop the system to include a broader range of sensory feedback, aiming for a multimodal approach that integrates touch, perception, and temperature sensations.Professor Silvestro Micera, senior author: “Temperature is one of the last frontiers to restoring sensation to robotic hands. For the first time, we’re really close to restoring the full palette of sensations to amputees. This is a very simple idea that can be easily integrated into commercial prostheses.”
