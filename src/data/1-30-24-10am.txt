Title: People Feel Detached From Leaders
Details: The CEO of the world's largest insurance company warns that growing detachment between political leaders and the working class presents the biggest risk in a busy election year.Oliver Bäte of Allianz published the Allianz Risk Barometer this month, which noted that political risk was already at a five-year high in 2023, with civil unrest risk high in about 100 countries. This trend is expected to deepen amid ongoing economic challenges.Bäte: “You’ve seen recent elections in the Netherlands, you’ve seen it in France, and societies are polarizing because our leaders are not addressing the needs of the people. We have an increasing detachment of the political elite from the working class and the people that actually go to work every day, and that, I see as the number one risk for our societies. And remember, this year a lot of people are going to vote, so we need to make sure that they vote for the right things and are not just venting anger.”Even in the U.S., a new poll this month found that 74% of Americans feel their leaders do not care about them.

Title: New Drug Cuts Off Pain At Source
Details: A Boston pharmaceutical company has engineered an experimental drug designed to alleviate moderate to severe pain. Unlike opioids, this drug targets peripheral nerves without impacting the brain, promising to avoid the risk of addiction.The approach was inspired by research into genetic mutations affecting pain sensitivity, including individuals who experience extreme pain or no pain at all due to specific genetic variations.Studies on over 2,000 post-surgical patients show significant pain reduction.

Title: Fast Food Using Forced Prison Labor
Details: Lawsuits filed against the prison systems in Alabama and Louisiana allege a “labor trafficking scheme” involving inmates. An Associated Press investigation has confirmed the allegations, discovering a link between some of the world’s largest food companies and most popular brands to jobs performed by U.S. prisoners nationwide.The Alabama lawsuit claims the system generates about $450 million annually, with inmates working for little to no pay for the benefit of private businesses that “employ” them, such as Burger King, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s. The prison system then generates revenue by automatically deducting 40% from a prison worker’s gross earnings, the lawsuit alleges.If the prisoners refuse to work, some can jeopardize their chances of parole or face punishment like being sent to solitary confinement. Further, the lawsuits claim that officials have reduced the rate of inmates receiving parole to maintain the labor pool.Under the Thirteenth Amendment, “slavery” or “involuntary servitude” is allowed “as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,” but the lawsuits say the prison systems violate the Trafficking Victims Protection Act as private enterprises financially benefited.

Title: China Crushing U.S. In Solar Power
Details: Last year, China installed more solar panels than the U.S. has in total. The Asian nation currently holds 40% of the world’s total solar capacity, far ahead of America’s 12%.Rystad Energy: “China’s solar sector is set to break records in the coming years. When installed capacity crosses the 500 gigawatts (GW) mark by the end of 2023, it will take 13 years to reach that milestone. That total, however, will be doubled to one terawatt (TW) in just three additional years.”The Chinese government’s ambitious targets, including plans to become carbon-neutral by 2060, have been a significant driving force behind this growth. The nation aims to build 1,200 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, a goal that is likely to be met five years ahead of schedule.Lin Boqiang, head of Xiamen University’s China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy: “The remarkable surge in investments in China’s renewable energy sector, particularly in solar and wind, underscores the country’s strategic focus on diversifying its energy portfolio and reducing reliance on traditional sources. China’s global leadership in renewable energy is evident not only in the scale of investments but also in the widespread adoption of innovative technologies and practices.”

Title: Can AI Carry On Creative Legacy?
Details: At 78, celebrated New York designer Norma Kamali is planning for the future of the company she has led for over 50 years. Her succession plan involves developing an AI version of herself to assist future leadership in maintaining the brand’s creative DNA.This AI tool is being trained with thousands of images from the brand’s archive to understand and replicate her style. It uses advanced models like Stable Diffusion XL and custom tools to analyze Kamali’s extensive work in categories such as swimwear.Norma Kamali: “The model will start to really be in the process of downloading my brain, so that when I train other people here to follow what I’ve done, the legacy of the company can literally continue and go on. I have the advantage of that because it’s 56 years of content and there’s only been one designer. It hasn’t had different identities. It hasn’t had that mix-up. It’s very exciting. It gives my company a really big value that way—in a way that nobody would’ve thought of before.”She continued: “I keep thinking about it as this baby that’s learning to walk, but it’s this genius at the same time. I’m going along with that. I’m learning and experimenting and each day I’m going to figure out how I integrate it into the future of the company.”

Title: City Votes On Banning Factory Farms
Details: Berkeley, California, is set to vote on banning factory farms, the first time any city in the U.S. has considered such a measure.Although there are currently no factory farms in Berkeley, the initiative is part of a broader strategy to eliminate industrial livestock production practices, activists say. They see this as a step toward abolishing factory farming nationwide, building on the city’s history of pioneering environmental policies.Factory farming dominates 90% of U.S. livestock production and faces widespread criticism for its treatment of animals and environmental impact. Public opinion shows a growing desire for change, with 57% of U.S. voters supporting greater oversight of animal farms.Many are still skeptical about how much activists can achieve. Factory farms are a powerful lobby in the U.S., receiving substantial federal subsidies, and the meat industry is known for aggressive opposition to reform efforts.

Title: First Reviews For Apple’s Vision Pro
Details: The first reviews for Apple’s $3,500 headset are in. The product will be available for sale on Friday.CNET’s Scott Stein: “Living in the Vision Pro for the past week has been one of the most complex experiences of all. It's one of the hardest products I've ever had to evaluate. Parts of it are stunning. Others don't feel entirely finished.” Stein used the headset as his “everywhere computer,” connecting it to his Mac. “There are glitches, and sometimes the controls feel too floaty, but in its first form, I'm shocked at how good it already is,” he noted.Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern: “The Vision Pro has every characteristic of a first-generation product. It's heavy, its battery life sucks, there aren't that many great apps yet, and sometimes, it's buggy.” She said the headset is at its best when used as a work computer and to watch movies.CNBC’s Todd Haselton: “The displays help remove the ‘screendoor’ effect that's common in lower-cost headsets like the Meta Quest 3. That's where you can see the pixels as you look through a headset. You can easily read text on a website or a book on the Vision Pro. And I was able to watch movies, including in 3D, on screens bigger and nicer than any TV in my house.”Ultimately, many reviewers agree that the Vision Pro is the biggest technological leap in VR ever, with an audio/visual quality that reimagines what can be done in the digital world. But with this being Apple’s first foray into the space, it appears some wonkiness is naturally present.

Title: Scientists Reveal Lab-Grown Sushi
Details: An Israeli startup has revealed the first-ever lab-grown eel, a staple in Japanese cuisine. Scientists hope it offers a sustainable alternative to traditional eel fishing, which has led to a drastic decline in wild eel populations.Forsea Foods’ technology involves growing eel meat from embryonic cells. This method, a first in the seafood industry, allows for production without depleting natural fish stocks. The product is expected to be commercially available as early as 2024.Overfishing and habitat destruction have significantly reduced the wild eel population, leading to its listing as endangered in 2018.
