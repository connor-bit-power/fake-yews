Title: One-Person Billion Dollar Company
Details: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts that companies run by a single individual will soon be able to reach a billion-dollar valuation because of AI advancements.Altman: “In my group chat with my tech CEO friends there’s this betting pool for the first year that there’s a one-person billion-dollar company—which would’ve been unimaginable without AI and now it will happen.”Remarkably, Altman’s optimism comes at a time when the tech world has been shaken by a wave of pessimism.

Title: U.S. Producing More Oil Than Ever

Rising energy output will be a tailwind to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, and will contribute to lower risk of a U.S. recession in 2024.”

Title: Early Bedtime: The New Cool

That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we’ll be talking about later this year.”
