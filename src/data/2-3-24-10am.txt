Title: Artists Urge Ban On AI Voice Cloning
Details: Nearly 300 artists, including 21 Savage, Cardi B, and Nicki Minaj, have signed an open letter supporting a bill to regulate AI cloning voices and likenesses.Introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on January 10, the No AI FRAUD Act seeks to establish a federal framework for protecting individual rights against nonconsensual deepfakes. It comes in response to incidents like viral fake songs, proposing a federal standard against using AI to mimic public figures without consent. Support for the legislation has come from major music companies and organizations.“The No AI FRAUD Act would defend your fundamental human right to your voice & likeness, protecting everyone from nonconsensual deepfakes,” the open letter reads. “Protect your individuality. Support HR 6943.”Representative María Elvira Salazar: “It’s time for bad actors using AI to face the music. This bill plugs a hole in the law and gives artists and U.S. citizens the power to protect their rights, their creative work, and their fundamental individuality online.”

Title: Many Foods Have Been ‘Pre-Digested’
Details: New reports reveal ultra-processed foods undergo a “pre-digestion” process, making them less filling and more addictive. This technique is akin to breaking down food to its molecular level, and then reassembling it with additives.A virology expert: “It’s an illusion of food. But it’s really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them in molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want.”The European Starch Industry Association: “The bulk of what is extracted is starch slurry, a milky mixture of starch and water, but we also have extracted proteins and fibers. Roughly half of the starch slurry goes to produce starch-based sugars and other derivatives. Those are created by hydrolysis, a process similar to human digestion.”This method is not only cost-effective for food manufacturers but also allows them to create a wide variety of products from a basic set of ingredients. Critics argue that such foods could have detrimental effects on health.

Title: Furniture Quality Is Garbage Now
Details: Furniture connoisseurs have noticed a decline in mass-market furniture quality, attributed to material innovation, cost-cutting, and changing consumer behaviors.Mike Coleman, owner of Big Mike’s Vintage: “I would bet all the money in my pocket that any furniture you buy on Amazon today will not last more than five years, especially if it says ‘made in China.’”CoCo Ree Lemery, furniture designer: “It’s every component that then combines together to make something that is fundamentally less durable.”Engineered wood products like medium-density fiberboard have replaced solid hardwood or plywood, contributing to the decline in furniture durability, experts note. Consumer demand for fast, cheap, and trendy furniture has influenced manufacturers to prioritize cost over quality, leading to a rise in “fast furniture.”

Title: Middle East On ‘Brink Of Abyss’
Details: Overnight, the U.S. launched strikes on 85 targets across Syria and Iraq, retaliating for the deaths of three American soldiers. The strikes, which Iraq condemned as a “new aggression against Iraq’s sovereignty,” reportedly killed 40 people. The Middle Eastern nation now warns the region is on the “brink of the abyss.”The U.S. used over 125 precision munitions to strike command and control operation centers, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, and more used by Iran-backed militias. This action marks the beginning of a series of expected responses to a drone attack by Iran-backed militants in Jordan.Iraqi official: “This aggressive strike will put security in Iraq and the region on the brink of the abyss, and it also contradicts efforts to establish the required stability.”

Title: China Rivals Musk’s Neuralink
Details: China has announced plans to develop “brain-computer interface” technology in a direct challenge to Elon Musk’s Neuralink. Critics warn the products could be used by the nation to spy on its own people, effectively turning them into “zombies.”Expected to be released by 2025, the technology is described as China’s “innovative iconic products,” according to its Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The country aims to achieve breakthroughs in brain-computer fusion, brain-like chips, and neural models. For instance, a 60-person laboratory dedicated to the technology has been established in China.So far, Chinese researchers have developed a device that connects to the brain via the inner ear, operating without an implant and capable of feeding data directly into the human brain.

Title: Spain Spends $3B To Live Without Rain
Details: Catalonia, Spain’s economic powerhouse, is investing $2.6 billion to combat drought. The region, home to the popular tourist city Barcelona, is adapting to a new climate reality.The investment focuses on desalination plants, a response to the increased likelihood of droughts due to global warming. Desalination is a process that removes salt from seawater, making it suitable for human consumption and irrigation.This strategic move comes as Catalonia faces a potential state of emergency due to water scarcity. The region’s dependency on rainwater is becoming unsustainable, and the plan aims to ensure water security by 2030. Desalination is a key part of this strategy, helping to reduce reliance on unpredictable rainfall.The region’s approach could serve as a model for other areas facing similar issues.

Title: Ozempic Is More Valuable Than AI
Details: The manufacturer of weight loss drug Ozempic is worth five times the value of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.Novo Nordisk’s valuation soared to $506 billion after massive sales of semaglutide-based drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, dwarfing OpenAI’s $100 billion valuation. Analysts note that determining OpenAI’s value is trickier, as it's not publicly traded, but the difference nevertheless indicates how extremely lucrative pharmaceutical companies have become.Interestingly, both products have introduced a wave of fear, with health experts warning of adverse side effects of Ozempic, and economic analysts pointing out the colossal job losses that AI could incur.

Title: Fake Science Papers Create Crisis
Details: The publication of bogus research papers has escalated into a global scandal, compromising medical research and drug development. In 2023, over 10,000 papers were retracted, a figure experts believe only scratches the surface of widespread scientific fraud.The proliferation of “paper mills,” especially originating from China, is a major contributor, producing fabricated studies for scientists looking to get ahead. The issue has spread globally, with journal editors being bribed and fraudulent papers invading major databases, misleading drug discovery efforts.Analysts note the trend could exacerbate the growing distrust in science. A Pew Research study from November found that the number of Americans who have a “great deal” of confidence in scientists has fallen from 39% in 2020 to 23%.Professor Alison Avenell of Aberdeen University: “Editors are not fulfilling their roles properly, and peer reviewers are not doing their jobs. And some are being paid large sums of money. It is deeply worrying.”Professor Dorothy Bishop of Oxford University: “The situation has become appalling. The level of publishing of fraudulent papers is creating serious problems for science. In many fields it is becoming difficult to build up a cumulative approach to a subject, because we lack a solid foundation of trustworthy findings. And it’s getting worse and worse.”

Title: OnlyFans Owner Is Top Israel Donor
Details: The owner of OnlyFans pledged $11 million to the pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), according to internal documents from the organization. This would make Leonid Radvinsky the biggest donor of anyone listed.Radvinsky denies the claims, telling a media outlet, “I didn’t donate or pledge $11M.” He didn’t explain why his personal information, including address documentation showing a wire transfer, was listed in the documents.Founded in 1963, AIPAC is the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying outfit in the U.S. The group had a massive $90 million fundraising haul following the Hamas attack against Israel on October 7—a war chest it has employed to target members of Congress who have voiced skepticism of U.S. support for Israel.

Title: Man Sailing From Cali To Hawaii
Details: The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking assistance to locate a 60-year-old man who embarked on a solo sail from California to Hawaii on December 28.Noel Rubio’s journey began from Long Beach, with his last known contact being the same day south of Catalina Island, California. Since then, there has been no communication from him.Despite extensive searches covering harbors in California, Hawaii, and Mexico, and issuing urgent marine information broadcasts, Rubio remains missing. His sailboat, Malulani, is equipped with only a VHF-FM marine band radio for communication.The Coast Guard is urging anyone with information about Rubio or the Malulani to contact rescue coordination centers in Alameda, California, or Honolulu.
