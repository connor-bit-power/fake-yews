Title: Cloned Monkey Survives For 2 Years
Details: The longest-lived cloned primate in the world has survived for over two years.Two years ago, scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully cloned a rhesus macaque with the same technique used to clone Dolly the sheep in 1996. This method involves taking DNA from something like a skin cell from a normal grown monkey and then injecting it into an embryo that has had its own DNA removed. The embryo is then carried to term by a surrogate.Dr. Qiang Sun, who created the first successful monkey clones in 2018, said he managed to develop a healthier placenta that improved the latest creature’s development. He claims the team has “improved the efficiency” of cloning monkeys, which they hope can one day be used for lab research, calling the success “remarkable.”Despite this achievement, the process remains controversial and challenging, with a low success rate of one successful birth from 113 attempts.Dr. Lluís Montoliu, who was not part of the research: “This cloning demonstrates two things. First, it is possible to clone primates. Second, but no less important, it is extremely difficult to succeed with these experiments, with such low efficiencies once again ruling out human cloning. These experiments could not have been conducted in Europe. Legislation prohibits the use of non-human primates unless the experiment is aimed at investigating a serious, life-threatening disease, which is not the case in this experiment.”

Title: Apple Hits #1 For Smartphones
Details: Apple achieved an all-time high market share of 20.1% in 2023, surpassing Android manufacturers for the first time annually.Samsung, now in second place, experienced a 13.6% drop in market share, holding 19.4% in 2023. Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Oppo also saw declines.Apple's success is attributed to its focus on premium devices, despite its higher average selling price compared to Android phones. The iPhone 14 Pro Max was the world's bestselling phone in 2023.Nabila Popal, analyst: “Apple's ongoing success and resilience is in large part due to the increasing trend of premium devices, which now represent over 20% of the market, fueled by aggressive trade-in offers and interest-free financing plans.”

Title: Bernie Sanders: Freeze Aid To Israel
Details: Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a resolution in the Senate this evening that called for an investigation into alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza. If these claims have merit, the resolution said, U.S. aid to the Jewish state should be frozen.The Vermont lawmaker forced a full Senate vote for the resolution, which was almost unanimously rejected. Just 11 senators supported the resolution, and all but one, Republican Rand Paul, were Democrats.The resolution came in response to the over 22,000 Palestinian civilian casualties from Israel’s military response to the Hamas attacks. Sanders, who is Jewish, has criticized the Gaza offensive as “illegal and immoral.”

Title: Earth-Powered Fuel Can ‘Last Forever’
Details: Researchers have engineered an innovative new fuel cell, powered entirely by microbes in dirt, that could “potentially last forever.”This soil-based technology, compact in size, is ideal for powering sensors in precision agriculture and environmental monitoring, operating effectively in both wet and dry soil conditions. Unlike batteries that contain hazardous substances and contribute to electronic waste, this soil-based fuel cell harnesses energy sustainably and harmlessly.Bill Yen, engineer: “The number of devices… is constantly growing. If we imagine a future with trillions of these devices, we cannot build every one of them out of lithium, heavy metals, and toxins that are dangerous to the environment. We need to find alternatives that can provide low amounts of energy to power a decentralized network of devices. In a search for solutions, we looked to soil microbial fuel cells, which use special microbes to break down soil and use that low amount of energy to power sensors. As long as there is organic carbon in the soil for the microbes to break down, the fuel cell can potentially last forever.”He continued: “If you want to put a sensor out in the wild, in a farm, or in a wetland, you are constrained to putting a battery in it or harvesting solar energy. Solar panels don’t work well in dirty environments because they get covered with dirt, do not work when the sun isn’t out, and take up a lot of space. Batteries also are challenging because they run out of power. Farmers are not going to go around a 100-acre farm to regularly swap out batteries or dust off solar panels.”

Title: LV Showcases Western-Inspired Line
Details: Louis Vuitton showcased its Fall/Winter 2024 menswear collection in Paris, the first under Pharrell Williams as creative director.The show, held at Jardin d'Acclimatation, featured an eclectic mix of Western-inspired fashion, including Damier denim suits, pixelated cow prints, and floral embroidered sets.Highlights included oversized Louis Vuitton handbags, monogram Timberland boots, and cowboy hats, emphasizing Pharrell's unique take on luxury fashion.Like Pharrell's previous shows, Louis Vuitton's FW24 guest list was equally as big as its pieces. In the crowd, we spotted Pharrell's many friends like Gunna, Karlie Kloss, Swae Lee, Playboi Carti, Bradley Cooper, and Lil Yachty. At the same time, familiar faces like Pusha T and Shedeur and Shilo Sanders walked the show.

Title: China Testing 100% Deadly Disease
Details: Chinese scientists linked to the country’s military have experimented with a mutant COVID strain that results in 100% mortality in mice. These findings were disclosed in a scientific paper that has not yet been published.The mice had been “humanized,” meaning they were engineered to express a protein found in people, with the goal being to assess how the virus might react in humans. Every rodent that was infected with the pathogen died within eight days, which the researchers described as “surprisingly” quick.Concerns are raised over the potential spillover risk of the mutant virus into humans, as well as the ethical implications of such experiments. Critics like Professor Francois Balloux at the University College London label the study as “scientifically totally pointless” and express concerns over potential mishaps.The absence of detailed biosafety measures in the study has also drawn criticism, with comparisons to the Wuhan lab potentially linked to the COVID pandemic.

Title: Gambler Gets Roasted By His Dealer
Details: A Twitch streamer experienced an unexpected confrontation during a live blackjack game.For years, streamers have been using the betting site FanDuel to gamble live. The site employs real dealers who are certainly aware that they’re being seen on streams watched by tens of thousands of people.Apparently, one streamer was upset with his dealer’s performance, telling his chat that he should be fired. The dealer caught wind of this and started communicating directly with the gambler.“Getting fired? Who’s getting fired?” the dealer said. “This is why I got two jobs. Who you think I was? You’re up at 4AM in the morning playing blackjack, you fucking loser.”

Title: Ubisoft: Gamers Shouldn’t Own Games
Details: The video game publisher Ubisoft is saying that physical and digital ownership of games is on its way out and subscription services will become the norm.The company’s CEO, Philippe Tremblay, notes that this transition is analogous to CDs and DVDs being phased out“One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.”In line with this, Ubisoft now offers two tiers of subscriptions that offer access to a catalog of games.The reception to this trend has been mixed. Some gamers appreciate the “Netflixification” of gaming, as it grants them a wide array of content. Others see this phenomenon as an excuse for companies to release unfinished games and then just continually update them over time.

Title: AI Can Now Copy Handwriting
Details: Researchers have developed an AI tool that can closely replicate a person's handwriting.The AI requires only a few paragraphs of writing for training, and its output is indistinguishable from actual handwriting, according to researchers.Although focused on English writing, the tool's potential for forgery and misuse is a concern. Researcher Rao Muhammad Anwer stated, “We are very cautious about it because it could be misused.”The team is considering measures to prevent forgery and sees potential applications in interpreting illegible writing, notably in medical contexts.

Title: Renewables To Surpass Coal By 2025
Details: At the COP28 Climate Conference last year, world leaders set a goal to triple renewable energy installations by 2030. The International Energy Agency predicts renewables will overtake coal as the largest electricity source by early 2025.The IEA's “Renewables 2023” report highlights a forecasted growth to 7,300 GW of global renewable power capacity from 2023-28, with solar PV and wind constituting 95% of this expansion. This comes as 40% of electricity in the U.S. alone is now emissions-free, with solar and wind set to top coal for the first time in 2024.Despite unprecedented growth, the IEA emphasizes the need for accelerated renewable energy expansion to meet the COP28 2030 goal, especially in emerging and developing economies.Faith Birol, IEA executive director: “Onshore wind and solar PV are cheaper today than new fossil fuel plants almost everywhere and cheaper than existing fossil fuel plants in most countries.”
