Title: Air Pollution Changes Flower Scent
Details: New research has revealed that pollutants are changing how flowers smell. This affects not just humans who enjoy floral fragrances but, more critically, insects that rely on these scents for pollination.Scientists found that nitrate radicals (NO3), originating from sources such as gas and coal, are masking the natural scents of flowers. This makes it difficult for pollinators like moths to locate flowers, especially in urban environments at night.The study used moths to determine if they could find flowers based on scent. Results showed a significant decrease in their ability to do so, with one moth breed being 50% less accurate and another unable to find the flowers at all during nighttime conditions.About 75% of the over 240,000 documented flowering plants require insect pollination and about 70 species of pollinators are currently endangered or threatened.

Title: Aquarium May See Miracle ‘Sharkray’
Details: A female stingray at a North Carolina aquarium is unexpectedly pregnant, despite no male stingrays in her tank. Aquarium staff initially mistook her swelling for cancer before ultrasounds revealed she was carrying multiple pups.Two theories exist for her pregnancy: parthenogenesis, where eggs develop without fertilization, or impregnation by a male shark added to her tank in July.The stingray, Charlotte, exhibited bite marks, a common sign of shark mating behavior, raising the possibility of a rare cross-species pregnancy.DNA testing on the pups after birth will determine if they are clones of Charlotte or possibly a mix between her and the shark.

Title: PETA Declares War On Carnivals
Details: PETA is taking on carnivals, advocating for the removal of their use of animal-themed carousel rides, arguing they contribute to the normalization of animal exploitation.The animal rights group sent a letter to Chance Rides, a leading manufacturer of amusement rides in the U.S., urging them to cease the creation of carousels adorned with horses and other animals. They suggest adopting non-animal motifs like cars, rockets, or celestial objects to foster creativity without harm.PETA’ President: “All animals are thinking, feeling, affectionate, playful, and social beings who form strong bonds with their offspring if permitted to keep them (a rarity). Animal-themed carousel sets reinforce the notion that these sentient beings are simply here for our entertainment, rather than individuals with the same capacity to experience fear, pain, joy, and love as any of us.”
