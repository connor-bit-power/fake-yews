Title: Californians: We Can’t Afford Kids
Details: A couple from California earning $200,000 annually claims they can’t afford to have children in the Golden State despite ranking among the top 10% of earners in the U.S. Beccy Quinn, 35, and Xavier Coelho-Kostolny, 36, have decided to join the increasing number of Americans going “child-free by choice.”“It's just impossible,” Coehlo-Kostolny, a 3D model designer, told the Los Angeles Times. “I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna work until I die.”“I would rather regret not having children, than regret having them,” said his wife, an actor and writer.The sentiment comes as birthrates are plummeting across the country, with over 250,000 fewer births since 2012 in the U.S. For instance, among graduates from Wharton Business School, one of the top MBA schools in the U.S., interest in becoming parents has dropped from 78% in 1992 to 42% in 2012. Many of these disinterested adults cite rising costs—according to a report from the Brookings Institution, it now costs $310,000 to raise a child to the age of 17.Earlier this month, a poll of 7,000 adults in the UK found that only 19% of younger Millennials expressed a definitive desire to have children, while 30% leaned toward probably wanting children.

Title: Tiny Homes: Future Of Housing?
Details: As the cost of housing surges across the U.S., home builders have deliberately downsized their dwellings to keep prices within reach of buyers. Many developers are now offering houses as small as 400 square feet to cater to prospective owners priced out of traditional, larger homes.This trend accelerated last year when the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reached a two-decade high, at nearly 8%. In a survey of architects, John Burns Research and Consulting found that about half expected their average house size to decline.“The monthly payment matters more than anything else and builders have responded with smaller, more efficient homes,” said John Burns, the company’s chief executive.“Their existence is telling,” said Ali Wolf, chief economist of Zonda. “All the uncertainty over the past few years has just reinforced the desire for homeownership, but land and material prices have gone up too much. So something has to give, and what builders are doing now is testing the market and asking what is going to work.”The shift, although still subtle right now, comes as young Americans have explored other unorthodox means of housing, such as living in car parks or vans.

However, the certainty of these stations becoming operational before the ISS’s retirement remains unclear.Meanwhile, China continues to make significant progress in space, marked by the development of its Tiangong space station.“If commercial platforms are not available ahead of decommissioning, our current partner nations will have no choice but to gravitate towards China,” Voyager Space CEO Dylan Taylor told a congressional hearing.

Ano was “angry and upset with my family, but I just wanted the difficult conversations to be over so that we could all move on.”
