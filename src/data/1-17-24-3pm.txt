Title: New Cancer Drug Kinder Than Chemo
Details: An 11-year-old with blood cancer was the first to benefit from a new drug treatment less toxic than chemotherapy.Blina is an immunotherapy targeting cancer cells while sparing healthy ones, unlike chemotherapy. Arthur carried the treatment in a backpack, allowing freedom from the hospital. The treatment involves a bag of liquid connected to a vein, controlled by a battery-operated pump, making it portable.Arthur experienced fewer side effects with blina, requiring hospital visits every four days for top-ups.Blina is already used off-label for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children in the UK and can replace up to 80% of chemotherapy.Arthur's mother: “It was completely out of his control - we were living in a constant challenge as his body was getting hit by the drugs. We were curing him by making him feel worse - it's a very difficult thing to process. New Year was when we found out that the blina had worked and there was no residual cancer - and so that was just amazing and so we had double celebrations.”Proffesor Ajay Vora, Consultant Paediatric Haematologist: “Blinatumomab is a gentler, kinder treatment.”

Title: Gen Z Thinks Driving Is Lame
Details: Gen Z is less interested in driving than previous generations, with only 25% of 16-year-olds and 45% of 17-year-olds holding a driver's license. In 1997, 43% of 16-year-olds and 62% of 17-year-olds were already on the road.McKinsey analysts suggest this trend might be due to environmental concerns, with Gen Z favoring sustainable transport options like public transit, ride-sharing, or e-scooters.One analyst: “It’s possible a sputtering economy and inflation tinged their entry into adulthood, discouraging spending on big-ticket items such as cars.”The cost of new cars has soared by 30%, while the price of used cars has also risen.One mother posted online: “I have a 21-year-old nephew who still has no plans on driving. And [my] 13-year-old [son] — I have a truck out front for him [when he’s old enough] — and he said, ‘I don’t need that. You’re gonna drive me or I’ll call an Uber,’”Another mother online complained: “I have a 16-year-old boy who has no desire to drive. We even bought him a Mustang.”

I understand you’re probably eager for me to do that.”Trump responded: “I would love it.”“I know you would,” Kaplan said back. “You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.”“You can’t either,” Trump muttered.Kaplan ruled that Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her in his 2019 statements.

Title: Canada Ranked Safest Place To Travel
Details: Canada has been named the safest travel destination for 2024 by Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection.The country moved up from sixth place last year, surpassing other safe destinations like Switzerland and Norway.Factors contributing to Canada's top ranking include its cold weather, low population density, and low incidence of violent and gun-related crime.BHTP considered a safe place to be “free of terrorist activity. Then it became a place that was safe from disease outbreaks. Now it’s a place where all types of people can move about freely without discrimination or harassment.”While Canada is currently safe, the ranking is not predictive and doesn't account for regional variations, such as wildfires in northern Quebec.

Title: Plants Caught Talking To Each Other
Details: Japanese scientists have filmed plants sending defense signals to nearby plants in response to threats, a breakthrough in plant communication research.The team observed undamaged plants reacting to volatile organic compounds emitted by other plants when attacked or damaged.The study used Arabidopsis thaliana, a common weed, genetically modified to fluoresce green when detecting stress messengers like calcium ions.This communication helps neighboring plants prepare for imminent threats, such as insect attacks, by receiving airborne warning messages.The discovery unveils the complex and hidden communication network among plants, enhancing our understanding of plant responses to environmental challenges.Masatsugu Toyota, Molecular Biologist: “We have finally unveiled the intricate story of when, where, and how plants respond to airborne ‘warning messages’ from their threatened neighbors. This ethereal communication network, hidden from our view, plays a pivotal role in safeguarding neighboring plants from imminent threats in a timely manner.”

Title: Man Pleads Guilty To Setting 14 Fires
Details: A 38-year-old man from Quebec has pleaded guilty to starting a series of fires that led to the evacuation of around 500 homes near Chapais.Brian Paré faced 13 counts of arson and one count of arson with disregard for human life, related to fires he ignited between May 31 and June 1.His actions forced residents of Chapais to evacuate for several days and burned over 3 square miles of forest.Prosecutor Marie-Philippe Charron said five fires in a short period in the same area raised suspicion. Provincial police and first responders “observed that some of the fires had no possible natural cause,” she said, adding that evidence was found that some of the fires had been criminally set. Charron said police first spoke to Paré on June 2. He had been seen in the area around where a fire had started and was considered a witness.

We talking [missiles] … advance technology… mental and physical warfare …. That’s not a lane for the older!”The rapper's tweet followed reports of Biden's claiming he spoke to Iran’s leaders, but they still went through with bombing Northern Iraq. In November, Meek put Biden on blast for allegedly lying about weapons deals in his hometown of Philadelphia.Charlamagne Tha God has also called out Biden, responding to Jill Biden's comments on the President's “vigor.”“I see Joe every day.

I see his passion every single day,” the first lady said.Charlamagne: “That’s really the conversation- is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris still a winnable ticket? … So to answer your question, uh, no. He doesn’t look full of vigor like his wife says. Not to me, anyway.”Charlamagne, expressing disappointment with the Biden-Harris administration, vows not to endorse anyone in the upcoming presidential race.“I don’t regret voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just because it kept Donald Trump out of the White House. What I regret is endorsing them. They come around and they court you, and they tell you sweet nothings and tell you all the things that you know you want to hear. But once you get in a relationship with each other, they don’t really back up a lot of those promises.”

Title: Ex-Gang Member Becomes Biz Owner
Details: A former Mongrel Mob member has turned his life around and now runs Topline Constructions, a successful construction company in Hastings. Founded in 2016, Topline has grown from two employees to 50, many of whom come from challenging backgrounds and are given a second chance.Taurus Taurima's company not only offers employment but also runs a training academy, teaching life skills, promoting a drug-free environment, and instilling respect in its staff. The Topline Contracting Academy focuses on helping young people, especially from Māori backgrounds, offering guaranteed employment upon graduation.Taurima: “I really changed [my life] for my children. I've got nothing really bad to say about the gang - I think everything they do is individually based - but I had to change my lifestyle for my children, before I spent any more time in prison and no one would actually get to spend any time or know their father personally. So I found a job in construction and worked my way through the ropes at a company here in Hawke's Bay and then decided to start Topline seven years ago.”“I probably went to maybe 100 or 200 places, and I mean proper workplaces… I didn't try and find a picking job or seasonal packhouse work. I went to try and find like, a proper trade, and that was really difficult. But I ended up finding some concrete boys on the concrete on the footpath on the corner near the house that I lived in and gave them some free labor until I could get my way in the door. And I think it's been pretty good from there.”“I opened up the Topline Academy, and linked up with the local councils and other businesses in Hawke's Bay too, do my part to take as many - I based it for Māori people, but as many people I could - off the benefit that were young, fit and healthy, but I guess were just lazy and didn't have no direction, and put them on a training academy that guarantees them 100 percent employment if they graduate.”“They just have to do three things - be healthy, drug-free and hard-working and [have a] positive attitude, and if they finish it and no one in Hawke's Bay employs them, then they land at Topline, at our contracting business.”
