Title: Men Find Solace In Looksmaxxing
Details: Young men around the world are turning to techniques like bone smashing and chin extensions in hopes of improving their looks. The trend, known as looksmaxxing, has gone incredibly viral on apps like TikTok, promoting the belief that all men have untapped potential.The trend emphasizes facial structure, such as the gap between the eyes, canthal tilt (the angles of the eyes), and mewing (a tongue exercise that improves the shape of the jaw). Some acolytes go so far as to promote surgical procedures, arguing that for many men “it’s over” unless they artificially change their appearance.One follower of the movement, James, told The Guardian that he became hooked on the trend, saying “the ultimate goal is to improve your SMV,” or Sexual Market Value.“I was learning about problems I hadn’t even noticed,” he said. “I had a short face and a short chin, my nose was too wide, my eyes were too far apart, my hairline was too high … You don’t see a lot of these things until someone else points them out and then you can’t stop seeing them.”Concerns arise about the trend’s tendency to amplify insecurities, with professionals warning against extreme measures and the pursuit of unrealistic beauty standards.

Title: Hero Tackles Gunman In Kansas City
Details: During the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade yesterday, one brave hero tackled an alleged active shooter.Paul Contreras: “He got close to me, I got the right angle on him, and I hit him from behind. And when I hit him from behind, I either jarred the gun out of his hand or out of his sleeve because as I’m taking him down to the ground, I saw the gun on the ground.”Contreras said he and another good Samaritan put all their weight on top of the alleged gunman to try to keep him down as he fought to get away.Contreras: “We were fighting each other. He wants to get up while I’m holding him down. Then another guy helps me and then you know, it just seemed like a long time but it’s probably like 15 or 30 seconds. He’s just fighting to get up. But we’re fighting to keep him down. We didn’t want to let him up and take off running because he had one gun. Maybe he had another in that big bulky jacket.”The man was taken away by police following the struggle, which Contreras said left him in a state of shock, noting he and his three daughters sat at the scene for a moment before heading home.The shooting left 22 injured and one dead.
