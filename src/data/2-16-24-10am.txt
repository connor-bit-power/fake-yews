Title: Local News Plays On Fears
Details: A media giant that owns over 185 local news stations across the U.S. tailors coverage based on what viewers fear the most. Every year, Sinclair Broadcasting sends short surveys to viewers asking them: “What are you most afraid of?” The findings mirror what the stations spend the most time covering, such as crime, homelessness, and failing schools.For instance, Sinclair purchased the Baltimore Sun last month, and CEO David Smith immediately told staff to start working on a documentary about Baltimore’s decline, according to current and former staffers.In Seattle, a local Sinclair station devotes a special section on its website to “Crisis in the Classroom,” focusing on dysfunction in city schools, and “Project Seattle,” which zeroes in on homelessness. The homepage is often heavy on crime stories.These revelations come as studies have found the most common emotions people feel after consuming news are anger, disgust, and fear.

Title: Robots Can Lay Bricks Like Humans
Details: A startup in Amsterdam has invested $25 million in robots that lay bricks as fast as humans, the hope being to fill a huge shortage of laborers the Netherlands is dealing with.The startup, Monumental, uses AI technology designed for self-driving cars and inexpensive robotic parts to create robots that can work on almost any new building site and at a cost that is comparable to human bricklayers. Executives promise these robots aren’t taking human jobs but are rather filling a gap in the labor market.The Netherlands requires 100,000 new houses a year to keep up with a growing population, driven in part by immigration, but the country only has enough construction workers to build 60,000 new units annually.“One of the biggest surprises for us is that we thought we would have to be slightly cheaper than humans. It turns out no one cares,” said Salar al Khafaji, the company’s co-founder and CEO.
