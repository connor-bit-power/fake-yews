Title: Strippers Want Bill Of Rights
Details: Strippers in Washington are advocating for comprehensive statewide protections, dubbed the “strippers’ bill of rights,” to enhance safety and respect in their workplace.The proposed legislation includes mandatory security guards at clubs, secure dressing rooms with keypad entries, and employee training on preventing sexual harassment and violence.The initiative stems from six years of advocacy by Strippers Are Workers, addressing regulation gaps in the 11 strip clubs across Washington, with similar efforts seen in few other states and local levels.The bills, avoiding last year’s dispute over alcohol in clubs, aim to cap club fees for dancers and ensure their safety without jeopardizing the businesses’ viability.Amy Walen, Democratic Rep, who sponsors the House bill: “It is a legal, licensed business operation in the state of Washington, so the people who work there deserve our attention and our respect and the protections that every other Washington worker gets.”

Title: Netanyahu Calls Ceasefire ‘Delusional’
Details: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed Hamas’ ceasefire and hostage proposal as “delusional.”Hamas had suggested a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza over four-and-a-half months, aiming for a permanent end to hostilities, but Netanyahu insists on a “complete victory” for Israel.The proposal also included a three-phase deal for the gradual release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, alongside a massive humanitarian and rebuilding effort in Gaza.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while in the region, saw potential for continued negotiations despite Netanyahu’s rejection, indicating some of Hamas’ conditions as “absolute non-starters.”Netanyahu: “We haven’t committed to anything. We haven’t committed to any of the delusional demands of Hamas, the numbers of terrorists with blood on their hands [to release]. There is not a commitment – there has to be a negotiation, it’s a process, and at the moment, from what I see from Hamas, it’s not happening. We are on the way to complete victory. The victory is achievable; it’s not a matter of years or decades, it’s a matter of months.”Hostages and Missing Families Forum: “If the hostages are not returned home: the citizens of Israel should know they live in a state that is not committed to their security, that the mutual responsibility in it has died. They who do not protect their citizens will find that their citizens lose faith in them and their leadership. The price is unbearable, but the price of abandoning the hostages will be a historic stain for generations to come.”

Title: State Wants Return Of Electric Chair
Details: South Carolina’s Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of the electric chair and newly introduced firing squad methods for executions, following a lawsuit by death row inmates. They argue these methods constitute cruel and unusual punishments.The state hasn’t executed anyone in nearly 13 years due to expired lethal injection drugs and companies’ reluctance to sell new ones without anonymity. The state has asserts that the law does not mandate “instantaneous or painless” deaths.A 2023 law allowing lethal injections to restart is under scrutiny for lacking transparency about the drugs and protocols used. Lawyers for the inmates demand details on the drugs’ potency and purity to ensure humane executions.South Carolina’s shield law, which keeps the identities of drug suppliers and execution details secret, has been criticized for being overly secretive compared to other states. The state argues this information is necessary to protect suppliers from public pressure.A lawyer for the Governor’s office: “Courts have never held the death has to be instantaneous or painless.”

Title: Disneyland Experts Are Now A Thing
Details: Families are now taking classes to navigate Disney World due to its increasing complexity, adding to the already high costs of visiting the parks.Travel planners offer guides and tutorials, including a $39 Zoom class, to help visitors manage their trip.The need for early morning wake-up calls and constant app monitoring has transformed what was once a vacation into a strategic operation. Visitors are advised to visit during Florida’s hottest months for lower crowd levels, suggesting a trade-off between comfort and convenience.Trip planner : “I’ve had people call me crying. I think the thing that people have the hardest time wrapping their brain around is not knowing how much it costs in advance.”Reporter: “It’s the one time in my life where I want to be looking around and taking in all the sights and smelling the flowers. The fact that you have to be so tethered to your app that you should probably bring an extra battery just to make sure you get on the one ride you want to get on is shortchanging the whole Disney experience.”

Title: Edit Photos With Your Words Alone
Details: Apple researchers have engineered an AI model designed to edit photos through simple text instructions.MGIE (MLLM-Guided Image Editing) allows users to perform photo edits, such as cropping, resizing, and color adjusting, by merely describing the desired changes in plain language.Designed for both simple and complex tasks, MGIE can adjust specific elements within an image, like changing shapes or adjusting brightness, and even adding vegetables to a pizza when prompted to “make it more healthy.”MGIE represents a leap towards integrating multimodal language models with visual tasks, although its future applications remain under wraps for now.Apple has made MGIE accessible via GitHub and a web demo on Hugging Face Spaces, showcasing their first step in the lucrative AI scene.

Title: Airline Now Weighs Passengers

In the 1960s, that number was just 10%.Finnair joins other airlines like Korean Air, Hawaiian Air, and Air New Zealand in adopting passenger weighing practices to address safety concerns.

Title: City’s UBI Boosts Quality Of Life
Details: Arlington’s first guaranteed income pilot provided $500 monthly to families earning below 30% of the area median income, significantly improving their quality of life. This initiative targeted parents with children under 18, who earn less than $46,600 annually.The additional income helped recipients get better-paying jobs, advance their education, and manage expenses like medical bills and debt. The Arlington Community Foundation, which oversaw the pilot, aimed to challenge the stigma around guaranteed income.Inspired by similar programs in Stockton, California, and Jackson, Mississippi, Arlington’s initiative aimed to persuade lawmakers to consider a form of guaranteed income nationwide, differentiating it from universal basic income policies.Participants primarily spent the extra funds on groceries, bills, rent, and essential household needs, reporting a significant increase in monthly income and improved physiological and physical well-being.Despite the program's end, the Arlington County Board has encouraged state and federal lawmakers to implement guaranteed income programs.One participant: “It’s a mental thing for me. Just the fact that I knew that I had an income coming, it helped me not have panic attacks. I knew I could have food for the kids and pay the bills. It allowed me to use my time to be wise about money and not stressed about money.”
