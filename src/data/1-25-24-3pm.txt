Title: Colorado Wants To Legalize Raw Milk
Details: Colorado is considering a bill to allow consumers to buy raw milk directly from farmers, joining states like New York and Texas in easing restrictions on unpasteurized milk sales.The FDA: “Decades ago, pasteurization of milk was adopted as a basic public health measure to kill dangerous bacteria. This measure largely eliminated the risk of getting sick from one of the most important staples of the American diet.”Meghan Davis, Ph.D., Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: “[Legalization] is going to potentially expose people who have [immune system] vulnerabilities or who are not prepared to accept the risks, and that’s a huge problem.”Krista Varady, Ph.D., Nutrition Professor at the University of Illinois Chicago: “Some people believe that food is healthiest when it is not processed at all by humans. [But] processing foods for safety reasons is a totally different thing.”

Title: MIT Bets On Personalized Shoes
Details: Engineers at MIT have developed new shoes predicting how properties impact runner performance. This method uses height, weight, and other dimensions, combined with characteristics like midsole stiffness and springiness, to simulate how they would run in a particular shoe.The research aims to create personalized shoe designs, optimizing footwear for individual running styles and needs. MIT is working towards a consumer-friendly version, possibly leading to 3D-printed shoes tailored to individual runners.Sarah Fay, a postdoc in MIT’s Sports Lab: “Shoe designers are starting to 3D print shoes, meaning they can now make them with a much wider range of properties than with just a regular slab of foam. If we tell our model, ‘Optimize your gait on these two things,’ it gives us really realistic-looking gaits that best match the data we have. This gives us confidence that the model can predict how people will actually run, even if we change their shoe.”Anette “Peko” Hosoi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT: “In some ways, this gives you a quantitative way to design a shoe for a 10K versus a marathon shoe. Designers have an intuitive sense for that. But now we have a mathematical understanding that we hope designers can use as a tool to kickstart new ideas.”

Title: Homeless Living In Intricate Caves
Details: In Modesto, California, rough sleepers were found living in furnished caves dug 20 feet below street level. The site, featuring murals and even a makeshift fireplace, was cleared by authorities, removing 7,600 pounds of trash.Local resident Tracy Rojas: “If one of these were to collapse, it would be devastating. This whole thing would come down and go into the water.”Volunteer Chris Guptill: “It's already been proven that people will dig these out, so I don't think filling them in with any material would work. We really don't have a known solution on how to deal with it.”California, facing a state of emergency over homelessness, has about a third of the country's homeless population, with Los Angeles being the hardest-hit city.

Title: Anti-Aging Elixir On Horizon
Details: New York researchers have developed a new therapy using engineered immune cells, targeting and eliminating senescent cells that contribute to age-related decline. This breakthrough could significantly advance treating age-related diseases and enhance our quality of life as we age.Senescent cells, which cease dividing and secrete harmful substances, accumulate in our bodies as we age, which can lead to various diseases. The new therapy targets these cells with a protein called uPAR, effectively eliminating them.Corina Amor Vegas, assistant professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: “If we give it to aged mice, they rejuvenate. If we give it to young mice, they age slower. No other therapy right now can do this.”The therapy, initially developed for cancer treatment, showed promising results in mice, improving physical and metabolic health without noticeable side effects. More research is needed before this therapy is available for human use.

Title: Texas Escalates Standoff With Feds
Details: Republican governors are backing Texas Governor Greg Abbott amid defying a Supreme Court decision by continuing to build barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.Ron DeSantis, Governor of Florida: “If the Constitution really made states powerless to defend themselves against an invasion, it wouldn’t have been ratified in the first place and Texas would have never joined the union when it did. TX is upholding the law while Biden is flouting it.”Glenn Youngkin, Governor of Virginia: The Biden administration “has turned every state into a border state.” Abbott is doing what the border officials “refuse to do to secure our border.”The federal government alleges that the Texas National Guard is obstructing Border Patrol duties. Democratic Texas Representatives Joaquin Castro and Greg Casar call for the nationalization of the Texas National Guard to enforce federal law and court decisions.Abbott’s statement Wednesday specifically claims the federal government has “broken the compact” with states, justifying the dismissal of federal law and the Supreme Court decision. The so-called “compact theory” is a rejected idea of state supremacy used to justify the secession of Confederate states during the Civil War.

Title: McDonald’s Spin-Off Rivals Starbucks
Details: McDonald’s coffee-focused spin-off, CosMc’s, experienced strong customer traffic in its first month. The Bolingbrook, Illinois location saw about twice the average traffic of a traditional McDonald’s.The cafe, which opened on December 7, focuses on lemonade, iced tea, energy drinks, and coffee, catering to late morning and early afternoon customers.R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai: “Admittedly, it’s tough to make definitive conclusions about CosMc’s with the location being open for only a few weeks.”Despite its smaller size, roughly 2,800 square feet compared to the typical 4,000-4,500 square feet McDonald's, CosMc's is attracting younger guests, with the largest share of visitors between 22 and 29 years old. McDonald’s plans to expand this concept with nine more locations in Texas this year.

Title: Tesla Erases $80B In Valuation
Details: Tesla shares fell 12% today, wiping out $80 billion in market cap in their largest one-day drop since January 3, 2023.Daniel Ives, Wedbush: “We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview.”Toni Sacconaghi, Bearish Analyst: “While 2024 will be a challenging year, it is becoming increasingly apparent that 2025 will likely not be better, with continued pressure on growth and margins.”Despite the current downturn, Tesla's stock has overperformed in the past 12 months, up nearly 27%, compared to gains of about 22% for the S&P 500 index.

Title: Quiet Outdoor Takes Over Quiet Luxury

Title: Man Politely Robs Bank
Details: One man acquitted of a previous bank robbery allegedly robbed another Chicago bank with a polite note, promising to “pay it back soon.” This occurred just 72 hours after his acquittal.In this latest incident, 31-year-old Mohamed Worku reportedly handed a bank employee a note and left with over $2,000. He was seen wearing a surgical mask, neon green gloves, and a winter cap.Mary Judge, Worku's former attorney: “Because of their not-guilty verdict, I believe the government is now charging both bank robbery and bank theft in a case where there is not evidence of force or threat of force — as it should be done.”Worku was arrested about half an hour after the robbery, with about $200 less than what he had obtained. He is now set to be charged with both bank robbery and bank theft, which do not require force or intimidation.

Title: Skin Cancer Now Detected In Seconds
