Title: Neuralink Implants First Brain Chip
Details: Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp. has implanted a brain device in a human for the first time. This significant step in brain-computer interface technology is part of FDA-approved trials, with the patient showing promising initial results.

Title: People Say Weekends Aren’t The Same
Details: More and more social media users are talking about how they prefer to spend their weekends quietly at home over socializing, attributing this change to COVID, which has ingrained in many a feeling of isolation.One user on TikTok said in a video: “Like, I don’t care about having plans on Saturdays or Sundays anymore. Even Fridays are just, like, I’m ready to go home. I think we're all tired from navigating a world of uncertainty within our lives and the reality we live in.”Her post sparked a flurry of people agreeing with her. Many commenters blamed the worsening economy and inflation for making going out a financial burden, while others said their social torpor was a result of the pandemic.One commenter wrote: “If I leave my house I spend at least $100. Everything is so expensive it's not fun anymore.”Psychologist Yasmine Saad told Business Insider: “The pandemic has reduced social pressures, enabling people to embrace their preferred style of recharging, whether it's through socializing or enjoying solitude. The goal is to engage in activities that internally rebalance and rejuvenate, without tipping into extremes.”

Title: State May Ban Addictive Algorithms
Details: California has proposed a law to combat social media’s adverse effects on children. The Protecting Kids from Social Media Addiction Act mandates social media platforms to use chronological feeds by default for users under 18, countering the addictive nature of algorithmic feeds.Key provisions of the law include disabling notifications from midnight to 6AM, capping daily usage at one hour, and hiding “like” counts for young users.Nancy Skinner, state senator: “Social media companies have the ability to protect our kids. They could act; they have not.”This follows other legal actions in California, like a lawsuit against Meta for allegedly addicting young users and a $93-million settlement with Google over deceptive data practices.

Title: Sustainable Food System Saves $10T
Details: A comprehensive economic study reveals that shifting to a sustainable global food system could generate up to $10 trillion in annual benefits.The current food systems contribute a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, leading to an estimated 37F increase in global warming by century’s end. These emissions exacerbate extreme weather conditions, harming harvests and increasing food insecurity.The study suggests redirecting subsidies and tax incentives away from environmentally damaging large-scale monocultures. Instead, it proposes supporting smallholders who can transform farms into carbon sinks, enhancing wildlife spaces.Diet change and technological investments are highlighted as essential elements of this transition. Successful implementation could eradicate undernutrition by 2050, preventing 174 million premature deaths, and ensuring a decent income for 400 million farm workers.The transition cost is estimated between 0.2% and 0.4% of global GDP annually.Dr. Steven Lord, University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute: “This analysis puts a first figure on the regional and global economic opportunity in transforming food systems. While not easy, the transformation is affordable on a global scale and the accumulating costs into the future of doing nothing pose a considerable economic risk.”

Title: Adults Paying To Learn How To Breathe
Details: One breathwork studio in New York City charges $400 an hour to teach effective breathing techniques. This practice is part of a growing wellness industry focused on helping people improve their primal function of breathing.Breathwork is an active form of meditation that involves a three-part breath, all in and out through the mouth, ideally done by lying on the back.Regular practice of breathwork can positively impact respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems, and manage sleep deprivation, according to experts. The wellness industry is increasingly incorporating advanced breathwork into its offerings.Dr. Sarah Rothman, naturopathic doctor: “Breathwork is an active and energizing form of meditation that allows the conscious mind to relax and taps into the subconscious mind.”

Title: Man Sues Snack Over Lack Of Cheese
Details: A Florida man has sued Mars, Inc., alleging Combos snacks falsely claim to have “real cheese.”Edward Pistorio argues the packaging is misleading as it shows a large block of cheese and the text: “Filling made with REAL CHEESE,” while the product contains less than 2% cheese blend.The main ingredients of Combos are wheat flour, palm oil, dairy product solids, carbohydrates, and cornstarch.The lawsuit contends that the “real cheese” claim justifies the snack’s “premium” price of $2.59, thus misleading customers.Edward Pistorio’s attorney: “More than half the public consider cheese ‘healthy’ and ‘nutritious,’ because it is high in protein and nutrients, with key vitamins and minerals like calcium. By replacing real cheese with palm oil and dairy product solids, the filling lacks the quality, nutritional, and savory attributes that consumers expect from a label indicating a ‘Filling Made with Real Cheese.’”

Title: iOS 18 Is ‘Biggest’ In Apple History
Details: Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 is anticipated to be the company’s most significant software update ever, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The announcement is expected at Apple’s annual WWDC event in June.Key features rumored include a new version of Siri, which will have advanced AI systems. This could revolutionize how Siri and the Messages app handle question responses and sentence auto-completion.iOS 18 may also introduce auto-generated playlists in Apple Music, similar to Spotify’s introduction last year.Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman: “I’m told that the new operating system is seen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates–if not the biggest–in the company’s history. With that knowledge, Apple’s developers conference in June should be pretty exciting.”

Title: Ten-Year-Olds Find Solace In Skincare
Details: Tween girls aged ten to 13 are increasingly influencing the beauty product market, spending grand sums on high-end skincare and makeup. Driven by social media platforms like TikTok, these young consumers are turning to more high-end featured products instead of cheap ones.One tween admitted to Axios: “Honestly? I don't even need makeup. I just love applying it. I love my skincare routine. Sometimes I use Kosas facial spray. It smells really good. I don't really know what it does, but it probably doesn't need to do anything. I don't need my skincare routine, but I feel weird if I go to sleep without doing my skincare. It's so fun to do.”Any given evening, she says, she's likely to use a face wash, a facial scrub, a lip exfoliant, a hydrating serum, a moisturizer, a highlighting serum, an eyelash serum, and a lip mask.Another tween added: “What adults don't understand is that it's not even to look good. It's just really fun to have a routine and stick to it.”

Title: Cops Predict Suspect’s Face With DNA
Details: Police in California used DNA to predict a suspect’s face and then tried to run facial recognition on it—the first known instance of this happening, and likely not the last.In 2017, the East Bay Regional Park District Police Department revisited the 1990 murder of Maria Jane Weidhofer, utilizing new DNA technology to generate a suspect's facial image. They received help from the company Parabon NanoLabs, which created a 3D rendering of the suspect based on DNA evidence. The report depicted a male with fair skin, brown eyes and hair, no freckles, and bushy eyebrows.The department then released the generated image to the public, a decision deemed controversial. In 2020, a detective requested to run the image through facial recognition software, despite it being against Parabon NanoLabs' terms of service.“Using DNA found at the crime scene, Parabon Labs reconstructed a possible suspect’s facial features,” the detective explained in a request for “analytical support” sent to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center. “I have a photo of the possible suspect and would like to use facial recognition technology to identify a suspect/lead.”The detective’s request has just been unveiled, found in a trove of hacked police records published by the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets.Jennifer Lynch, general counsel at civil liberties nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation: “It’s really just junk science to consider something like this. There’s no real evidence that Parabon can accurately produce a face in the first place. It’s very dangerous because it puts people at risk of being a suspect for a crime they didn’t commit.”

Title: Scientists Want To ‘Back Up Earth’
Details: The Arch Mission Foundation is creating a “Global Knowledge Vault” in a Swiss Alps bunker.This project stores human history on quartz disks, designed to survive nuclear holocausts.The vault holds Wikipedia, the Rosetta language archive, and will include books, photos, and cultural records.Nova Spivack, Arch Mission Chairman: “If something really bad happens on Earth, this will be our planetary insurance policy - our backup. It seems increasingly likely that something catastrophic could happen in our lifetime. This project is literally about saving the world - all our knowledge, history, art, science, and culture - so it can never be lost. It’s like the Seed Vault, but for information.”
