Title: BMG Cuts Ties With Roger Waters
Details: BMG, a music rights company, has ended its relationship with Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters due to comments about Israel, Ukraine, and the U.S.Waters was criticized by some as being “antisemitic,” which led to the cancellation of a planned release of a re-recorded version of Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon.”The musician has faced numerous backlashes, including a German police investigation and legal battles over his concerts in Germany.Waters defends his position, suggesting that his separation from BMG is a result of pro-Israeli interest groups influencing BMG's parent company and suppressing his political views.Roger Waters: “They’re trying to cancel me like they canceled Jeremy Corbyn and Julian Assange. I will not be canceled.”This move by BMG is notable as it’s uncommon for publishing deals to be severed compared to recording contracts, as seen in cases involving other artists facing public controversies.

Title: ‘Floating Cities’ Surge In Popularity
Details: Billionaires are exploring the concept of floating cities in international waters, seeking independence from land-based laws and refuge from potential land-based disasters.The Seasteading Institute has dedicated 15 years to researching permanent floating communities, envisioning a life free from conventional regulation.In 2022, Ocean Builders, backed by a Bitcoin trader, revealed the ‘Seapod,’ featuring 733 square feet of living space standing seven feet above water.Past attempts at floating homes, like one constructed off Thailand’s coast in 2019, faced legal challenges, including a police raid and the government asserting these actions challenged the nation's sovereignty.Despite setbacks, the idea of self-governing, floating cities gains global interest, with projects in Korea and elsewhere aiming to tackle issues like overpopulation and rising sea levels.Joe Quirk, President of the Seasteading Institute: “The technology for floating startup governments is at hand and we’re eager to make it happen as soon as possible. I came here from the opposite of a floating city, which is San Francisco. A lot of people are not satisfied with the way it’s governed. But imagine if we could bring San Francisco up into lots of little pieces, and people could move about and choose the neighbors they want. We'd have variation by governance providers and selection by citizens. Let a class of people try lots of ideas, so we'll discover the best solutions for how to live.”

Title: Hip-Hop For Dogs Makes Millions
Details: One music producer has achieved over a billion streams by creating music specifically for pets, not humans.Amman Ahmed’s venture began with experimenting and using feedback from dog owners, leading to music that effectively relaxes dogs and cats.The idea gained traction during the pandemic when pets developed separation anxiety due to increased time spent with their owners.Ahmed’s company, Music For Pets, has been acquired by Create Music Group, planning to invest $10 million in the company and its brands Relax My Dog and Relax My Cat.The service, costing $4.99 a month, has over 42 million animal listeners, offering playlists and videos tailored for pets’ relaxation and entertainment.Ahmed: “I initially started out making music for people to help with insomnia - and one friend joked, ‘Let me try that on the dog.’ Then we started to get messages about how the music was the only thing that would help dogs with their anxiety - and how even particular songs were the ones that helped. So we built from there.”

Title: U.S. Warns Tourists About Caribbean
Details: The U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for The Bahamas and Jamaica due to significant increases in crime, including homicides and robberies.The Bahamas advisory, at Level 2, urges “increased caution” following the rise in gang-on-gang violence, with 19 homicides reported in Nassau since the start of the year.Jamaica’s advisory has been escalated to Level 3, advising U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel” amid ineffective local police responses. In Jamaica, 65 homicides were recorded by January 27, which is surprisingly a decrease from previous years.Other Caribbean nations like Turks and Caicos and Trinidad and Tobago are also experiencing spikes in violent crime.Bahamian Police Chief Superintendent: “When we talk about 1,500 rounds of a certain ammunition, we have saved 1,500 lives because it only takes one round to kill or injure someone.”Keith Rowley, Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago: “There are very few diseases that kill more people in CARICOM than arms and ammunition.”

Title: Study: Fasting Cures Disease
Details: A new study suggests that fasting or calorie restriction can decrease inflammation, potentially benefiting conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Type 2 Diabetes.The research found that fasting increases arachidonic acid levels in the blood, which acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, reducing the activity a protein complex linked to chronic diseases.The study involved 21 volunteers who consumed a 500-calorie meal, fasted for 24 hours, then ate another 500-calorie meal, showing elevated arachidonic acid levels during fasting.However, it's too early to claim fasting as a preventative measure for diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, but it suggests potential long-term health benefits of calorie restriction.The study also sheds light on the beneficial effects of drugs like aspirin, which inhibits the breakdown of arachidonic acid, leading to reduced inflammation, but caution is advised for long-term use without medical guidance.Professor, University of Cambridge “What’s become apparent over recent years is that one inflammasome in particular – the NLRP3 inflammasome – is very important in several major diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis, but also in diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, which mostly affect older age people in the Western world. It’s too early to say whether fasting protects against diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, but our work adds to a growing amount of scientific literature that points to the health benefits of calorie restriction.”
