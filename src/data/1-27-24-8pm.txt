He plans to create a tiny home community for rental income, offering homes for $750 to $800 per month. However, concerns about the livability of these “shed” tiny homes arise, with additional work potentially required for full-time living.All of them seem to include a finished home containing fixtures like a bathroom, flooring, windows, doors, and pre-set hook-ups for ventilation/heating/cooling arrangements.Graim: “You can get one as low as $18,000. I wanted to get one that I can try to make into a decent-sized space where I can get some residual income coming in monthly. The goal is to bring in over $800 a month. I think we’ll be able to do that easily with this.”

Title: Cops Are Using Lie Detectors More
Details: An increasing number of cops in the UK are using the polygraph, allowing them to get to the truth without expending vast amounts of resources. People arrested on suspicion of committing online child sex offenses, for example, could be asked to take a test.According to one official, some of these criminals are researching ways to beat the tests. “There's a lot of techniques they do but we spot 90% of them or more,” the test examiner reassured the public.

Your heart rate physically increases because you're triggering the autonomic nervous system, which triggers a fight, flight or freeze response. You want to run away.”The tests provide “invaluable information we would otherwise not have had about offenders' behavior which helps us to better protect the public,” the UK’s Ministry of Justice said.
