Title: More Epstein Files Unsealed
Details: More court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein were unsealed today. According to them, the financier trafficked an underage victim in a scheme that involved “numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.”A document from 2014 added that Epstein "required" the girl, identified only as Jane Doe #3, "to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.” It also alleged that former Epstein girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell "had direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein."The revelations come one day after hundreds of pages of documents pertaining to Epstein were unsealed, containing nearly 200 names, many of which are high-profile politicians, businessmen, and celebrities.

Title: Epstein’s Ties To Mossad Resurface
Details: The unsealing of the Epstein files last night has revived allegations that the financier was an agent for Israel’s spy agency, Mossad.Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who met with Epstein around 36 times, is mentioned briefly in the files, stirring up long-standing rumors about the Jewish state’s ties with Epstein. Barak was also pictured in 2016 entering Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse with a scarf around his face. Young women were seen coming in and out of the residence that same day.Ex-spies have long claimed that Epstein's sex trafficking was a Mossad honeytrap operation to get compromising material on influential figures. Former Mossad operative Ari Ben-Menashe said in an interview that Epstein was introduced to espionage by his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's father, Robert Maxwell, who was allegedly a Mossad agent himself.Ari Ben-Menashe, former Mossad operative: “Prince Andrew wasn't being blackmailed, he was being used as a useful idiot. He was being used to bring in some of the celebrities.”Journalist Julie K Brown, who broke the Epstein case for the Miami Herald: “It's not beyond the realm of possibility that Epstein had connections to Mossad. Robert Maxwell certainly had those kinds of connections, and Epstein had a close relationship with Robert Maxwell.”

Title: News Anchor Tells Boy To Touch Grass
Details: A 13-year-old boy achieved what has long been seen as impossible: completing the video game “Tetris.”Willis “Blue Scuti” Gibson played until the game crashed, a result of reaching such a high level that the coding froze, unable to generate more blocks. This is something many players have tried and failed to do, an almost impossible feat that requires the utmost concentration and perfect “Tetris” play to achieve.Despite this accomplishment, Sky News presenter Jayne Secker dismissed the young boy’s grind, telling Gibson to “go outside.”During a segment on the story, she said: “Step away from the screen. Go outside. Get some fresh air. Beating ‘Tetris’ is not a life goal.”Those online have largely rallied behind Gibson, criticizing Secker's comments as “smug” and “embarrassing.”One user on X wrote: “Literally history was made, by a kid no less, and she throws that stupid ass comment in there, just embarrassing.”

Title: Genes Can Now Be Turned On And Off
Details: Scientists have engineered a method to control modified genes in patients like a light switch, potentially allowing diseases to be cured more easily than ever.The research involved modifying RNA molecules with a “stop sign” that can be masked off by binding with tetracycline, an FDA-approved antibiotic drug typically used to treat acne. This approach avoids the immune response issue common with other gene regulation systems, which the body often attacks as foreign.The technique holds promise for treating conditions like cystic fibrosis by adjusting therapeutic protein production according to the disease's stages and the patient's specific needs.Laising Yen, medical research professor: “This strategy allows us to be more precise in the control of gene expression of a therapeutic protein. It enables us to adjust its production according to disease’s stages or tune to the patients’ specific needs, all using the FDA-approved tetracycline dose.”

Title: City Has Curfew Amid Youth Violence
Details: A city in Mississippi has approved a curfew for minors to tackle a surge in youth violence, effective from next month until January 1, 2025.Jackson’s curfew restricts those under 18, prohibiting weekday hours from 10PM to 6AM and weekend hours from midnight to 6AM.Councilman Kenneth Stokes: “We need to save these children. Too many of our children are involved in criminal activity. Too many are involved in being out 'til 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the morning. Too many of our children are not going to school and they should be in school. We need to save our children.”A parent whose child is found breaking the curfew will receive a written warning for the offense. After that, it will increase to $25 for each subsequent offense: $25 for the first, $50 for the second, and so on.Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba supported the curfew but stressed the importance of having the right tools, such as implementing curfew centers with social work professionals. Critics argue juvenile curfews can be ineffective and disproportionately impact minority communities, while supporters believe they can decrease crime rates and protect youths.

Title: World’s Deadliest Cat Is 3 Pounds
Details: An eight-month-old black-footed cat named Gaia, weighing just three pounds, has become the newest member of the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City.Despite its size, the black-footed cat is a formidable predator. She’s more successful than lions, being capable of making high jumps and long lunges and consuming up to 3,000 rodents annually. Cats like her are believed to have a 60% success rate of catching prey.Gaia was moved to the Small Animal facility to aid in the conservation of this endangered species, which is native to parts of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, with fewer than 10,000 left in the wild. Plans are in place for her to mate with a male black-footed cat at the zoo to increase the species' numbers.Bob Cisneros, Hogle Zoo’s associate director of animal care: “They’re considered the fierce cat. These guys are voracious hunters. She’s settling in at night when everybody’s gone. When we all come in, she’s hunkered down in her little cave. She’s a pretty feisty cat.”
