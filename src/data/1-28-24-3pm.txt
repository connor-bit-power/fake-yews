Title: Mom Sues TikTok For Harming Daughter
Details: One mom is suing TikTok, alleging that the app negatively impacted her 12-year-old daughter. Brittany Edwards’ daughter, referred to as Amber, used to be active in dance and sports but became withdrawn and constantly engaged with TikTok.Amber’s behavior drastically changed after downloading TikTok at age 11, despite the app’s policy to prevent those under 13 from signing up. She began to spend most of her time on her phone, becoming insular and less interested in previous activities.Edwards noticed disturbing content on Amber’s TikTok, including inappropriate language and references to suicide, drugs, and sex. This led to a one incident where Amber posted suicidal thoughts.Around 5,000 parents have joined Edwards in legal action against TikTok, seeking compensation for mental health issues they claim are caused by the app.

Title: Cruise Ships Are Becoming Very Sexual
Details: In 2023, there was a record high of 131 reported rapes and sexual assaults on cruises, compared to 87 in 2022 and 101 in 2019.Experts suggest the actual number of incidents is likely higher, as nationally, two out of three sexual assaults go unreported.The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act does not protect non-U.S. citizens, and a narrow definition of rape is used by cruise lines to underreport incidents.Ongoing lawsuits against MSC Cruises include allegations of a crew member raping a passenger and failure to protect a minor from molestation.The FBI works with the Department of Transportation under the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act to publish crime statistics, which show sex crimes far outpace other reported crimes on cruises.

Simply put: it’s out of sight, out of mind.”

Title: Marvel Recasting Kang The Conqueror

Title: Consumers Reject Processed Foods
Details: A 2023 IFIC report reveals 84% of Americans prioritize a healthy diet.Popular dietary patterns include high protein (18%), mindful eating (17%), and calorie counting/clean eating/intermittent fasting (12% each).Taste is the most important purchase driver for 87% of consumers, followed by price (76%) and healthfulness (62%).Key health improvements include eating more fruits and vegetables (18%), practicing balance and moderation (14%), and reducing sugar intake (13%).However, there’s confusion about what defines processed food, with 48% unable to fully explain it despite efforts to limit consumption.The report shows varying perceptions of processed foods across categories, with canned fruits and store-bought cookies widely seen as processed, while many consider Greek yogurt and homemade smoothies less so.

Title: San Fran Too Expensive For Top 1%
Details: A former Goldman Sachs analyst states a family of four needs over $230,000 annually to live comfortably in San Francisco.Sam Dogen, who retired at 34 with a $3 million net worth, now lives off passive income from stocks, bonds, and real estate. Now, the financial guru says his investments will generate just $230,000 before tax. His annual expenses are projected to exceed $288,000 in 2024, requiring a pre-tax income of about $420,000.Dogen’s major expenses include $80,400 for private school tuition, $24,000 for healthcare, and $68,400 for housing.One study found the average American needs $3,455,305 to achieve the American Dream, defined as “owning a home, a car, a pet and sending two children to school,” but the average lifetime earning is about $2.3 million.Sam Dogen: "It really is a struggle to raise a family in an expensive city, save for retirement, figure out how to spend a lot of time with your kids before they leave for college, and enjoy life in general. The best way to combat inflation is to save aggressively and invest consistently. History has shown that risk assets like real estate and stocks tend to outperform inflation overtime. Therefore, it behooves everybody to save and invest as much as possible for as long as possible.”

Title: Study: Vegan Diet Risks Pregnancy

Title: NASA Engineers Super Strong Wheels
Details: NASA has engineered the Superelastic Tire for future Moon and Mars missions, and it could be used on Earth.The tire is made from shape memory alloys like Nickel-Titanium, allowing it to withstand high deformation without damage.Unlike conventional tires, the Superelastic Tire doesn't require air or an inner frame, enhancing durability and efficiency.This technology has led to a Kickstarter campaign to commercialize these tires for cars and bikes.NASA: “The novel use of shape memory alloys capable of undergoing high strain as load-bearing components, results in a tire that can withstand excessive deformation without permanent damage. Using shape memory alloy as radial stiffening elements can also increase the load-carrying capacity of the tire. The Superelastic Tire offers traction equal or superior to conventional pneumatic tires and eliminates both the possibility of puncture failures and running ‘under-inflated,’ thereby improving automobile fuel efficiency and safety.”
