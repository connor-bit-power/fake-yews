Title: Music Impacts Different Parts Of Body
Details: Researchers have mapped out how various music genres trigger specific bodily sensations, in a new understanding of music’s physical impact.Sad songs evoke feelings in the heart and stomach, while aggressive songs stimulate responses in the head. Happy and danceable songs are felt in the head and feet.The study involved 2,000 participants from Europe, North America, and China, with the study’s author stating, “Music’s influence on the body is universal.”Lauri Nummenmaa, study co-author: “Certain acoustic features of music were associated with similar emotions in both Western and Asian listeners. Since these sensations are similar across different cultures, music-induced emotions are likely independent of culture and learning and based on inherited biological mechanisms.”Vesa Putkinen, lead researcher: “People move to music in all cultures, and synchronized postures, movements, and vocalizations are a universal sign for affiliation. Music may have emerged during the evolution of human species to promote social interaction and sense of community by synchronizing the bodies and emotions of the listeners.”

Title: Hackers Could Destroy ‘World Order’
Details: Microsoft’s CEO warned in an interview that hackers could cause a “breakdown of world order” if global leaders don’t establish a “cyber Geneva Convention.” The cautionary outlook comes after Microsoft detected attacks by Russian hackers earlier this month, which compromised a small percentage of corporate email accounts.CEO Satya Nadella called for the U.S., Russia, and China to unite and guard themselves against cyber attacks from malevolent states. “If this is about nation-states attacking each other, and especially civilian targets, then we are in a very new world order. And it's a breakdown of world order, which I think we have not seen before,” he said.The Geneva Conventions, comprised of four laws, were drafted in 1949 and lay out how civilians and soldiers should be treated in war. Microsoft has long advocated for international rules to protect the public from nation-state cyber threats, proposing a Digital Geneva Convention as early as 2017.

Title: Hugo Boss Is Banking On Holograms
Details: Hugo Boss is set to display 32-foot-tall holograms of supermodel Gisele Bündchen and South Korean star Lee Min-ho in London to promote its BOSS line.The holograms are created using an array of transparent LED screens and special lighting, aimed to provide an immersive experience for the audience. They’re part of a campaign to establish Hugo Boss as a tech-forward company, exploring new avenues to stand out in the competitive digital advertising space.Nadia Kokni, senior vice president of Global Marketing and Brand Communications at Hugo Boss: “A hologram is larger than life. It still disrupts your day-to-day journey. If you’re used to the endless monotonous scroll, there’s still something spectacular about, ‘Is it or is it not real?’”Hologram technology has advanced rapidly. There’s ABBA’s hologram tour, the Sphere in Las Vegas, and virtual exhibitions that let audiences walk through the work of artists like Vincent Van Gogh, just to name a few examples.

Title: UMG Pulling Music From TikTok
Details: Universal Music Group (UMG) plans to pull its catalog from TikTok, citing unfair compensation and concerns about AI-generated music.In an open letter, UMG accused the app of attempting to “bully” and “intimidate” into accepting a deal that undervalues music and underpays artists and songwriters. In response, TikTok said the music corporation is spinning a “false narrative” and has “put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters.”UMG: “TikTok is allowing the platform to be flooded with AI-generated recordings—as well as developing tools to enable, promote and encourage AI music creation on the platform itself—and then demanding a contractual right which would allow this content to massively dilute the royalty pool for human artists, in a move that is nothing short of sponsoring artist replacement by AI.”TikTok: “It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters. Despite Universal’s false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent. TikTok has been able to reach ‘artist-first’ agreements with every other label and publisher. Clearly, Universal’s self-serving actions are not in the best interests of artists, songwriters and fans.”

It still has a sizable audience and is a perfect example of there being an appetite for something. So we continue to feed the beast. There’s no indication that the show is going to end anytime soon. It feels strange to reach the 25th anniversary. I’ve just been going at a dead run ever since the show premiered. Between then and now just feels like one really long day to me.”He added: “I think the goal of the show is just to make people laugh… It delves into social allegory and politics now and then without question, as a good primetime animated show should, but that’s always secondary. It’s a room full of comedy writers who just want to fucking laugh.”Fox renewed “Family Guy” for its 22nd and 23rd seasons in January 2023, indicating the show’s continued success and appeal.

Title: Gen Z Splurging On Luxury To Cope
Details: Young Americans are spending more than they probably should on luxury goods as a way to soothe their economic despair.For instance, Nia Holland, 24, told Bloomberg she spent $2,500 on a vintage Chanel bag because “the economy sucks, there’s global warming, there’s constant political and social unrest globally. It’s just easier to spend money on things that will bring you immediate fulfillment.” Holland is getting financial support from her family as she pursues a doctorate in education and psychology.People are increasingly spending during uncertain times, figuring their financial futures are doomed no matter what. About 27% of Americans admit to “doom spending” to cope with concerns about the economy and foreign affairs. The rates are even higher among Millennials and Gen Z, at 43% and 35% respectively. Higher student debt loads, an increased cost of living, and shifts in the labor market have all exacerbated this trend.

Title: Closet Has Tanning Bed, Champagne Bar

This special space is more than just a place for clothes—it's a social hub where friends gather, complete with pink champagne and a vibrant atmosphere.The transformation, costing around $120,000, reflects a growing trend of luxury home closets getting bigger and more expensive, as homeowners look to display increasingly extensive, curated fashion collections. Closets are also doubling as entertaining spaces, with seating areas and champagne bars where owners can host friends.Some of these closets alone have budgets reaching $200,000 to $300,000. Features like thumbprint-protected jewelry cases and revolving shoe racks are becoming common.In one hi-tech closet, a camera takes pictures of each outfit and sends images to a digital folder. The system allows the client to select outfits remotely and have an assistant pack.Matthew Quinn, a closet designer, said one of his clients spent over $1 million on a two-story closet with a spray-tan booth and an elevator. “Because it isn’t shared, in a closet you can have more fun and show your personality,” Quinn said.
