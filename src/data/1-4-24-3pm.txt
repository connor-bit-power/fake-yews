Title: Apple Loses $100B In One Day
Details: Apple's market value plummeted by over $100 billion in a single day, which is more than the combined worth of Ford and GM.The sharp decline was primarily due to the “lackluster” sales of the iPhone 15, with concerns that the upcoming iPhone 16 will follow suit due to a lack of new features.Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded Apple shares, leading to an immediate 4% slide in the stock price to a seven-week low of around $184.Although a significant amount of Apple sales are from China, they are also dwindling due to the rise of local competitors like Huawei and government restrictions on iPhone usage.Amid these challenges, Apple is diversifying its manufacturing base, moving some production from China to India.Tim Long, Barclays Analyst: “We see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.”Danni Hewson, Top Financial Analyst: “Once again Chinese competition is a factor but as high interest rates do the job they were designed to do and consumers continue to think carefully about big-ticket purchases, tech like iPhones are the ultimate nice to have that many potential customers may end up putting off buying until their budgets are less constrained.”

Title: Notre Dame Renovation Sparks Outrage
Details: Over 125,000 people signed a petition opposing the replacement of the historic Notre-Dame windows with modern art.President Macron had suggested moving the original Eugène Viollet-le-Duc's 1859 windows to a museum and installing contemporary artworks in a sign of the 21st century.The 2019 fire spared the windows but damaged two-thirds of the roof and spire, and is now under restoration.Public outcry previously influenced the decision to keep the 19th-century spire design.The letter, published by La Tribune de l’Art, reads: “How can we justify restoring stained glass windows that survived the disaster and then immediately remove them? Who gave the head of state the mandate to alter a cathedral that does not belong to him, but to everyone. Emmanuel Macron wants to put the mark of the 21st century on Notre-Dame de Paris. A little modesty might be best. We will not be cruel enough to remind you that this mark already exists: fire.”The roof and spire should be completed by the Summer Games in July 2024.
