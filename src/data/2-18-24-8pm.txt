Title: ‘Olympics On Drugs’ Gets Big Funding
Details: The Enhanced Games, known as the “Olympics on drugs,” has received significant financial backing from investors, including PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel. The first competition is set for December.Athletes in these games can use any drugs, with events spanning athletics, aquatics, gymnastics, strength, and combat. The creator, British businessman Aron D’Souza, believes this will break records and attract new fans, saying some athletes have already expressed interest. Critics, including athletes and anti-doping agencies, condemn the idea as dangerous.D’Souza: “This is the route towards eternal life. And what is performance medicine about? It’s not about steroids and getting jacked muscles. It’s about being a better, stronger, faster, younger athlete for longer. And who doesn’t want to be younger for longer.”“I want to see a 40, 50, 60-year-old break world records. Wouldn’t that be amazing? And as soon as we break the 100m world record, the mile world record, who’s going to want to watch the old, slow Olympics? Is NBC going to pay billions of dollars to broadcast a slow sporting event? Are cities going to invest billions of dollars to host a slow sporting event? They’re not going to,” he added.

Title: Air Pollution Is Making People Lazier
Details: A new study found that air pollution is making people lazier. Scientists in the UK claim pollution levels in their nation are causing an extra 22 minutes of inactivity per day.Rising levels of nitrogen dioxide, a common air pollutant, were linked to this increase in sedentary behavior.The study involved 644 individuals, using accelerometers to track their activity over three years. Researchers defined inactivity as time spent lying down, sitting, reclining, or standing without moving.Dr. Jonathan Goldney: “This could encourage more time spent indoors and less time being active outside, creating a vicious cycle that increases the risk of chronic diseases. If air pollution is indeed driving this rise in inactivity, measures like low emission zones could significantly impact individual sedentary behaviors and have a profound effect on public health.”This isn’t the only surprising byproduct of air pollution. Researchers earlier this month concluded that pollutants adversely affect male fertility, impacting basic sperm parameters such as sperm concentration, sperm motility, morphology, and semen volume.

Title: World’s Most Admired Company: Apple
Details: Apple has secured the top spot on Fortune’s list of the world's most admired companies for the 17th consecutive year.The ranking is based on a survey of around 3,700 executives, directors, and analysts, evaluating companies on nine criteria, including investment value and global competitiveness.Amazon and Microsoft follow Apple in the rankings, maintaining the top three positions for four years, with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase also ranking in the top five.Each year, the survey process begins with 1,500 companies, focusing on the highest-revenue firms in each industry, and narrows down to 660 for the final evaluation.Other notable companies in the top ten include Costco, Alphabet, American Express, Walmart, and Nvidia.

Title: Chernobyl Gave Animals Superpowers
Details: Nearly 40 years after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, scientists remain amazed by the transformations animals in the exclusion zone have undergone. High radiation levels have essentially given these creatures “superpowers,” with a period of “rapid evolution” occurring when radiation was at its highest.Wolves in the zone have developed genetically altered immune systems that show resilience to cancer, potentially aiding human cancer research. Frogs have changed from green to black, with higher melanin pigment correlated to a better chance of survival. Studies on bird wings found bacteria more resistant to gamma radiation.Remarkably, entirely new dog populations may have been created, as DNA analysis of feral dogs in the zone revealed significant differences compared to dogs elsewhere.Researcher: “The individuals from the power plant and Chernobyl City are genetically distinct.”

Title: Man Politely Robs Bank
Details: A man allegedly robbed a Chicago bank with a polite note, promising to “pay it back soon.” This happened just 72 hours after he was acquitted of a previous bank robbery.In this latest incident, 31-year-old Mohamed Worku reportedly handed a bank employee a note and left with over $2,000. He was seen wearing a surgical mask, neon green gloves, and a winter cap.Worku was arrested half an hour after the robbery, with about $200 less than what he had obtained. He’s now set to be charged with both bank robbery and bank theft, which do not require force or intimidation.

Title: U.S. Enters New ‘Gilded Age’
Details: While retail sales in general have been falling, the ultra-wealthy are spending more on luxury goods and experiences. Their spending has grown by the same amount the average person’s spending has decreased.Last year’s boom in the $2.1 trillion luxury goods market was driven almost entirely by wealthy Gen Z and millennials. According to an analysis from Bain, “the spending of Gen Z and even the younger Generation Alpha is set to grow three times faster than other generations through 2030.”Additionally, the boom wasn’t fueled by China but by the U.S. Specifically, it was New York that doubled down on its status as the luxury capital of the world.Luxury experts say there’s simply been so much wealth created over the past two decades that even a 20% stock market price correction is a blip for the top 5% of the market. There is now also intergenerational wealth, leading brands like Vuitton, Hermès, and Chanel, whom people have grown up with, to especially prosper.Rana Foroohar, analyst: “One of the most interesting differences between the post-COVID luxury boom and the post-2008 market is that, this time around, there seems to be no worry about conspicuous consumption.”

Title: AI Can Now Sleep And Dream
Details: Researchers have discovered that AI can better retain what it learns by mimicking human sleep and experiencing “dreams.”This new training method, called wake-sleep consolidated learning (WSCL), imitates how human brains transfer short-term memories to long-term ones during sleep. In WSCL, AI models are trained in an “awake” phase with data, followed by a “sleeping” phase where they review a mix of new and old data, enhancing their ability to retain information.Crucially, WSCL also has a period of “dreaming,” when the AI consumes entirely new data made from mashing together previous concepts. For instance, the animal model might be fed abstract images showing combinations of giraffes crossed with fish, or lions crossed with elephants. This helps to merge previous paths of digital “neurons,” freeing up space for other concepts in the future. It also primes unused neurons with patterns to help them pick up new lessons more easily.Researcher: “The point is that, as you gather new knowledge, you just combine more complex patterns. You might combine panda, giraffe, and leopard, so you’ll create this very strange mythological figure, and that will force the model to learn more complex patterns that maybe in the future can be reused.”

Title: UK Using Robocops To Protect Nukes
Details: The UK aims to introduce an AI-powered “robocop” force equipped with paint bombs and smoke guns to secure nuclear sites.With a £1.5 ($1.9) million investment, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is seeking initial designs for a robotic defense force to boost security while reducing labor costs. The proposed “roboforce” would reduce the reliance on the current security force which employs 1,600 people and cost £130 ($165) million last year.A government spokesman said that police officers will be able to control the technology without being exposed to danger: “They will be able to override the system, or investigate and deal with intruders from a control room.”

Title: China’s ‘Emotional’ Train Station
Details: An architecture firm in China has revitalized a historic train station, incorporating an underground terminal and public park to prioritize “the emotional and spiritual needs of citizens.”The project, named “Train Station in the Forest,” expands the original 1907 station with modern facilities while keeping its historic charm. Over 210,000 bricks, made from local mud, were used in reconstructing the station, blending tradition with modern design. Additionally, 1,500 trees were planted to connect the site to an existing park, embodying a less imposing, community-focused approach.Ma Yansong, architect: “We can break away from the common pursuit of grandiose monumental buildings and make them urban public spaces with transport functions, natural ecology, and cultural life, where citizens are happy to go, stay, meet, and enjoy.”

Title: Seaweed Could Survive Nuclear War
Details: A team of international researchers says seaweed could survive a nuclear war and avert famine. The algae, rich in nutrients, already provide livelihoods for coastal communities in many lower-income countries.The scientists used available nuclear winter climate data to simulate seaweed growth after a catastrophic global event. They discovered the food source can still grow in reduced sunlight scenarios, typical of nuclear winters, by photosynthesizing with lower light levels.Amazingly, within nine months of intensified seaweed farming following a global disaster, nearly half of the global food demand could be met.Scientist: “Investing in the construction of seaweed farms could prevent global famine in abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios, potentially averting a significant number of deaths from starvation.”
