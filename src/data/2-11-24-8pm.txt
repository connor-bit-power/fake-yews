Title: Ye Drops Greatest Super Bowl Ad
Details: A legendary Yeezy ad aired during the Super Bowl, featuring a selfie video of Ye telling viewers to visit yeezy.com. All items featured on the site are available for $20.In other regions, another Yeezy commercial aired promoting “Talking” featuring North West.

Title: Chiefs Win In Overtime: 25-22
Details: The Kansas City Chiefs pulled off a stunning victory (25-22) against the San Francisco 49ers with just a few seconds left in overtime.In his post-game interview, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said he gives “all glory to God.”

Title: Travis Kelce Melts Down Mid-Game
Details: One Super Bowl moment that caught viewers off guard was when Kansas City’s Travis Kelce suddenly shoved his head coach after being sidelined.The tight end was seen screaming at 65-year-old Andy Reid, demanding he be kept in the game, until Chiefs reserve running back Jerick McKinnon intervened and pulled Kelce away.

Title: Billions Of Rare Minerals In Wyoming
Details: Over two billion metric tons of rare earth minerals have been discovered in Wyoming, enough to allow the U.S. to surpass China and become the “world leader” in producing technology like smartphones, hybrid cars, and military weapons.American Rare Earths announced its Wyoming expedition has uncovered 2.34 billion metric tons of minerals which have “exceeded our wildest dreams.” Notably, the discovery greatly surpasses China’s 44 million metric tons, and American Rare Earths has only drilled about 25% of the property it has in the state.Don Swartz, CEO of American Rare Earths: “China is driven to maintain its market dominance. This is now a race. This is now a race.”

Title: Strangers Can Detect Your Aura
Details: A new study reveals strangers can accurately assess someone’s life satisfaction and positive emotions after a mere brief interaction.The research involved 200 college students being photographed and videotaped during self-introductions. Strangers were asked to evaluate the students’ well-being based on these short introductions.Significant correlations were found between self-reported life satisfaction, positive affect, and evaluations made by strangers. Interestingly, key cues of happiness included a loud voice and physical attractiveness.

Title: Robot Performing Surgery In Space
Details: Scientists have sent a tiny robot to the International Space Station to perform simulated surgeries in space, with a surgeon back on Earth remotely instructing the device. The experiment will test how zero-gravity impacts surgeries, paving the way for medical procedures in space.The robot, MIRA, weighs just two pounds. During the experiments, the robot “will use its left arm to grasp, and its right arm to cut, much like a human surgeon in a hospital operating room,” according to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.Besides the possibilities in outer space, the mission could also advance remote surgical techniques in general. This goal is especially significant, as it would help address the projected shortage of up to 30,200 surgical specialists in the U.S. by 2034.

Title: Popular Foods Are All ‘Pre-Digested’
Details: New reports reveal ultra-processed foods undergo a “pre-digestion” process, making them less filling and more addictive. This technique is akin to breaking down food to its molecular level, and then reassembling it with additives.A virology expert: “It’s an illusion of food. But it’s really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them in molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want.”The European Starch Industry Association: “The bulk of what is extracted is starch slurry, a milky mixture of starch and water, but we also have extracted proteins and fibers. Roughly half of the starch slurry goes to produce starch-based sugars and other derivatives. Those are created by hydrolysis, a process similar to human digestion.”This method is not only cost-effective for food manufacturers but also allows them to create a wide variety of products from a basic set of ingredients. Critics argue that such foods could have detrimental effects on health.

Title: Spain Prepares For World Without Rain
Details: Catalonia, Spain’s economic powerhouse, is investing $2.6 billion to combat drought. The region, home to the popular tourist city Barcelona, is adapting to a new climate reality.The investment focuses on desalination plants, a response to the increased likelihood of droughts due to global warming. Desalination is a process that removes salt from seawater, making it suitable for human consumption and irrigation.This strategic move comes as Catalonia faces a potential state of emergency due to water scarcity. The region’s dependency on rainwater is becoming unsustainable, and the plan aims to ensure water security by 2030. Desalination is a key part of this strategy, helping to reduce reliance on unpredictable rainfall.The region’s approach could serve as a model for other areas facing similar issues.

Title: AI Needs Sleep Like Humans
Details: Researchers have discovered that AI can better retain what it learns by mimicking human sleep and experiencing “dreams.”This new training method, called wake-sleep consolidated learning (WSCL), imitates how human brains transfer short-term memories to long-term ones during sleep. In WSCL, AI models are trained in an “awake” phase with data, followed by a “sleeping” phase where they review a mix of new and old data, enhancing their ability to retain information.Crucially, WSCL also has a period of “dreaming,” when the AI consumes entirely new data made from mashing together previous concepts. For instance, the animal model might be fed abstract images showing combinations of giraffes crossed with fish, or lions crossed with elephants. This helps to merge previous paths of digital “neurons,” freeing up space for other concepts in the future. It also primes unused neurons with patterns to help them pick up new lessons more easily.Researcher: “The point is that, as you gather new knowledge, you just combine more complex patterns. You might combine panda, giraffe, and leopard, so you’ll create this very strange mythological figure, and that will force the model to learn more complex patterns that maybe in the future can be reused.”

Title: First Puppy To Regrow Jaw
Details: A three-month-old French bulldog has astoundingly re-grown most of his lower left jaw after it was removed for a cancer surgery. This marked a first in canine medical history and the puppy, Tyson, is now cancer-free.Within eight weeks post-operation, Tyson’s jaw began to regenerate, bone and all. Cornell University veterinarians attribute the miracle to his young age, though the exact mechanisms remain a mystery.Beyond surviving cancer, Tyson has thrived, enjoying life and sparking hope for future veterinary treatments.Tyson’s owner: “We had no idea his jaw would grow back.”Researcher: “More has to be done to understand the likelihood of this occurring in other dogs and if a specific age range makes a difference. But this case documents a very positive surgical outcome in a life-threatening situation. His case now demonstrates the possibility of complete bone regeneration when working with a patient this young.”
