Title: Charity Creates $16M Fund For Artists
Details: The New York Foundation for Arts, a charity funded partially by the government, has announced a $16 million fund for artists to fuel their careers. In particular, 12 recipients will each receive $100,000 over two years.Unlike traditional grants focused on project proposals, this fund offers unrestricted grants to support artists’ broader needs, allowing them to focus on their creative work without immediate financial constraints. The approach reflects a shift toward recognizing and sustaining the labor for artists’ practices.The foundation’s advisory board includes prominent figures from New York’s art institutions. An anonymous group of academics, artists, and curators will nominate the initial grant recipients, with announcements planned for mid-July.Corina Larkin, executive director: “Given the world that we live in, with so many other urgent crises, the role of the artist is even more precarious. We’re just trying to give people some time, space, and recognition.”

Title: Plastic Linked To 10% Of Early Births
Details: A new study has found that one in ten premature births in the U.S. are linked to plastic chemicals found in thousands of consumer items.The chemicals, called phthalates, are used to soften plastic and can be found in items including plastic containers and wrapping, beauty care products, and toys. Phthalates have been identified as affecting the endocrine system and have been associated with obesity, heart disease, some cancers, and fertility problems. They are particularly concerning for pregnant women because they can trigger early labor and preterm births.The study analyzed phthalate levels in over 5,000 pregnant women’s urine, revealing that those with the highest exposure had a 50% increased risk of giving birth before 37 weeks. This data suggests that nearly 56,600 preterm births in the U.S. in 2018 could be attributed to phthalate exposure.Experts recommend reducing exposure to the chemicals by avoiding plastic food wraps and personal care products containing them. Additionally, heating food in plastic containers, whether in microwaves or dishwashers, can increase phthalate absorption into food.Lead study author: “The people who are producing plastic are not paying for the health effects. They’re not caring for these preterm babies.”

Title: ‘Deranged Loner’ Could Start Pandemic
Details: One of Britain’s most renowned scientists is warning that a “deranged loner” could easily create the next pandemic using homemade biotech equipment. ‌Laboratories, equipment, and expertise are becoming increasingly available globally due to the democratization of science.Lord Rees, the co-founder of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, said during an address that the world’s experience with COVID “is not the worst that could happen.”“The real nightmare will be a deranged loner with biotech expertise, who does not care who becomes infected or how many,” he said. “There are thousands of academic and industrial labs around the world where dangerous pathogens are being studied and modified. An increasing number of individuals will acquire the requisite expertise. The dangers are looming ever larger; regulation of biotech is needed ever more today... This is the stuff of nightmares.”

Title: First Aristocrat Poses For Playboy
Details: A German princess has become the first aristocrat to pose for Playboy. Princess Xenia of Saxony, 37, says her late royal ancestor, King Frederick Augustus III, “would have definitely approved.”The princess aims to challenge conventional beauty standards and celebrate natural beauty, including embracing her stretch marks. Xenia’s shoot includes various bold images: one with a white sheet partially covering her, another topless by a pool, and a third in a white bodysuit, unsnapped at the crotch to reveal her chest.Princess Xenia: “Every woman is beautiful the way she is. You don’t have to conform to trends or have surgery on your body just to please someone. I have stretch marks and I’m proud to show them.”

Title: Taco Bell, KFC Seen As Too Expensive
Details: Taco Bell and KFC are facing pressure from consumers as they report weaker sales in the fourth quarter of 2023.This plummet reflects a broader issue in the fast food industry with rising prices leading to consumer pushback. On Monday, McDonald’s CEO bluntly stated the fast food brand needs to win back the “low-income consumer.”In Q4 of last year, Taco Bell saw a growth of 3% in sales, a decrease from the 11% growth the previous year. Pizza Hut’s U.S. sales dropped by 4%, and KFC’s sales remained flat, missing analysts’ expectations. The figures come as dining-out costs have surged by 5.2%, while grocery prices rose by just 1.3% in 2023.

Title: China Puts Giraffes On Watchlist
Details: China has quietly censored giraffes on social media after the animal became an overnight symbol of discontent with the country’s economy.Giraffes gained fans in China after the U.S. Embassy made an unrelated post involving the animal that mysteriously went viral on Chinese social media. Investors flooded the giraffe post last weekend with comments complaining about China’s slumping stock market, leading activists to quickly adopt the figure as a symbol of revolt.“Arise! All giraffes who refuse to be slaves,” one user wrote. Yet hours later, giraffe-related hashtags were banned and all comments referencing the mammal were unexplainably wiped.“According to relevant laws, regulations, and policies, the content of this topic is not displayed,” said a notice on Weibo, the main Chinese social media platform.

Title: MILF Porn On Rise In Japan
Details: Japan’s “silver porn” market is booming, reflecting the country’s super-aging society due to its record-low birthrate.One woman, 65, has appeared in dozens of adult movies. Following a divorce in her 50s, she was getting by on wages from supermarkets before discovering the growing porn genre. Her two adult daughters, with whom she lives in Tokyo, were surprisingly supportive. “They said I looked comfortable with the idea, so they were happy for me to go ahead.”She’s not the only one. An 88-year-old Japanese woman, who didn’t make her debut until her early 80s, has also gained fame for her work. The Guinness World Records has recognized that the oldest porn stars come from Japan.Last year, the proportion of Japanese aged 80 or older reached one in ten for the first time. This came as fewer than 800,000 babies were born, the lowest figure since Japan started keeping records. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called the situation a “crisis” and has channeled billions of dollars toward potential solutions, such as incentives for having kids.

Title: Major Street Artists Sue Guess
Details: Street artists have once again filed a lawsuit against the clothing brand Guess for using their graffiti work without permission. The controversy centers on the brand incorporating graffiti tags verbatim into their designs, aiming to capture an “urban cool” vibe without the artists’ consent.The tags appear to be interspersed with a mishmash of streetwear iconography: cassette tapes, street signs, graffiti, and a spray-painted version of the Guess logo.Macy’s, one of the retailers carrying the disputed line, has removed the products from their website following the lawsuit’s filing. However, the items remain available on Amazon.Jeff Gluck, a lawyer for the artists, said that Guess’ use of the tags was “just mechanical, verbatim reproductions of the actual tags, the actual artist signatures.” The lawsuit comes after Banksy accused Guess of illegally using his work in 2022.Lawsuit: “Guess has inexplicably, and without notice, let alone consent, prominently splashed [the artist’s] work across their apparel in a transparent effort to lend credibility and an air of urban cool to their apparel by coopting the Plaintiffs’ special combination of graffiti style and street art bona fides.”

Title: Analyst: Metaverse Could Work Out
Details: One hedge fund manager with over two decades of experience in tech believes the highly-expensive metaverse could ultimately be a success.According to Business Insider, the unidentified man said: “I think Zuckerberg's metaverse bet could actually work out. It could take another ten or 20 years, but it could work.” This optimism comes despite Zuckerberg’s futuristic venture losing around $46.5 billion since 2019.The hedge fund manager compared the emerging technology to Microsoft Windows, which at first was seen as a highly expensive and futile endeavor, taking years to fully develop. But it gradually cemented itself as the single-largest platform, and now tech companies want to engineer the next big platform, with Zuckerberg taking the helm.Business Insider: “This is why big tech companies are investing 100s of billions of dollars to find the next big platforms. They might fail, and that will be an epic waste of money, like the world has never seen before. But, if they succeed, the profit gusher will be so much bigger, and competitors will bow down.”

Title: State Considers Banning Fast Cars
Details: A newly introduced bill in California aims to prevent new cars from going ten miles per hour over the speed limit. It would require any car made or sold in the state in 2027 or later to have special technology installed called “speed governors,” which would make it physically impossible to go past the speed limit.Scott Wiener, the California senator who introduced the bill: “I don’t think it’s at all an overreach, and I don't think most people would view it as an overreach, we have speed limits, I think most people support speed limits because people know that speed kills.”Wiener’s legislative track record also includes a bill in 2020 to eliminate automatic sex offender registration for young adults who have anal or oral sex with a minor.
