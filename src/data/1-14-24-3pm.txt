Title: NASA Unveils ‘Quiet’ Supersonic Jet
Details: NASA and Lockheed Martin have introduced the X-59, a “quiet supersonic” experimental aircraft aimed at revolutionizing air travel.The X-59's aerodynamic design, funded with a $248 million grant from NASA in 2018, aims to reduce supersonic booms to a “sonic thump.”Pam Melroy, NASA Deputy Administrator: “In just a few short years we’ve gone from an ambitious concept to reality. NASA’s X-59 will help change the way we travel, bringing us closer together in much less time.”This innovative technology, while still years from general use, could open new commercial markets for U.S. companies.

Title: Veterans Rescue Thousands Of Children
Details: Project Dynamo has launched “Operation: Lighthouse” to combat child trafficking, focusing on U.S. children trafficked to Mexico.Project Dynamo was established during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and has rescued about 7,000 people globally from disaster areas and conflict zones.Bryan Stern, project founder: “Our intent is to rescue American kids who have somehow made their way out of the country, who are being trafficked globally. Human trafficking in America… is a disease. It's a terrible thing afflicting our country, no different than fentanyl, a commodity business targeting innocent Americans.”He pointed to a Florida sting operation that ended with 123 arrests this week and rescued 28 trafficking victims. U.S. law enforcement does not need his help, he added, but Project Dynamo aims to operate in places where American law enforcement has little to no footprint, as it has done in its rescue operations for the past three years.“If the jurisdictions don’t allow, and the resources don't allow, and the power of the United States government doesn’t allow, somebody, something and somebody has to act” he said. “The Dynamo motto is, ‘Don’t be a spectator.’”

Title: ChatGPT Can Now Be Used For War
Details: OpenAI has quietly removed language from its terms and conditions that explicitly prohibited the use of its technology for military purposes.The policy, until January 10, had a clear ban on “activity that has high risk of physical harm,” including “weapons development” and “military and warfare.”The new policy update retains the order not to “use our service to harm yourself or others,” citing “develop or use weapons” as an example, but eliminates the explicit ban on “military and warfare” use.Niko Felix, OpenAI spokesperson: “We aimed to create a set of universal principles that are both easy to remember and apply, especially as our tools are now globally used by everyday users who can now also build GPTs.”

Title: ADHD Drug Use Soared During COVID
Details: Adult prescriptions for ADHD medications surged during COVID. According to a new study, prescriptions for stimulants used to treat the condition jumped for young adults and women during a two-year window after the pandemic hit in March 2020.Prescriptions also soared for non-stimulant treatments for adults of all ages, the U.S. FDA researchers found. The pandemic's shift to telemedicine and regulatory changes allowed for easier access to ADHD treatments.The spike in ADHD medication demand, coupled with manufacturing issues, led to ongoing drug shortages, affecting patients and healthcare providers.Overall, pharmacists counted more than 300 drug shortages in the U.S. as of last fall.

The Biden Indictments against his Political Opponent will never be allowed in this Country, they are already beginning to fall! MAGA!!!”The attack comes as Trump campaigns in Iowa amid severe winter weather.

Title: MIT Engineers Hydrogen Motorcycle
Details: MIT's Electric Vehicle Team has engineered a hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric motorcycle with swappable parts. Its body and engine can be easily changed, so the maintenance, repair, and experimentation are easier to carry out.MIT is expected to make the plan available online so the riders can create their versions at home or in their workshops.The motorcycle was showcased at the Hydrogen Americas Summit and CES 2024 and is set to appear at the World Hydrogen Summit in the Netherlands in May 2024. The electric motorcycle successfully took its first full test-track demonstration in October 2023.Built on a 1999 motorcycle frame, the prototype includes a mix of donated components and custom-made parts, supporting its electric motor, hydrogen tank, fuel cell, and drivetrain.

Title: Denmark Has New Male Monarch
Details: King Frederik X ascends to the Danish throne following Queen Margrethe II's abdication after over five decades.The historic transition was marked by a cabinet meeting at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, with large crowds gathered to witness the event.Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen publicly proclaimed King Frederik's accession, continuing a tradition since the constitution of 1849.King Frederik X: “Today the throne is passed on.

And the crown prince that now becomes our monarch is a king that we know, a king that we like, and a king that we trust,” she said.Queen Margrethe, Europe’s longest-reigning monarch, chose to abdicate due to declining health, marking the first time in 900 years a Danish king or queen has abdicated.

Title: George Carlin Family Slams Comedy AI
Details: “George Carlin: I’m Glad I’m Dead,” an AI-generated comedy special, has been released, featuring an AI impersonation of the late George Carlin, who passed away in 2008.The hour-long special, which dropped on Tuesday, comes from Dudesy, a comedy AI that hosts a podcast. In the stand-up special, the AI-generated impression of Carlin, who died in 2008 of heart failure, covered topics like mass shootings, the American class system, social media, and AI itself.Kelly Carlin, the late comedian’s daughter, responded on X: “My dad spent a lifetime perfecting his craft from his very human life, brain and imagination. No machine will ever replace his genius. These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again. Let’s let the artist’s work speak for itself. Humans are so afraid of the void that we can’t let what has fallen into it stay there. Here’s an idea, how about we give some actual living human comedians a listen to? But if you want to listen to the genuine George Carlin, he has 14 specials that you can find anywhere.”AI Carlin in his set: “I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would. I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush.”He continued: “There’s one line of work that is most threatened by AI — one job that is most likely to be completely erased because of artificial intelligence: stand-up comedy. I know what all the stand-up comics across the globe are saying right now: ‘I’m an artist and my art form is too creative, too nuanced, too subtle to be replicated by a machine. No computer program can tell a fart joke as good as me.’”

Title: New Therapy Heals Alzheimer’s
Details: Researchers are seeing promising results in healing Alzheimer's after pairing focused ultrasound with antibody therapies. The treatment accelerated the removal of amyloid-beta plaques from patients' brains, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease.Focused ultrasound opened the blood-brain barrier, enhancing the efficiency of anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody treatments. More than 98% of drugs are blocked by the barrier, which means patients require higher doses and more frequent therapies.The study showed a 32% greater reduction in amyloid plaques in areas treated with ultrasound after six months when compared to non-ultrasound areas.Dr. Ali Reza, study lead: “This was a first in human safety and feasibility study in three participants demonstrating that the BBB opening can accelerate clearance of beta-amyloid plaques. Non-invasive focused ultrasound is an outpatient procedure that allows for targeted delivery of therapeutics to the brain that can potentially accelerate the benefit of the antibody treatment in Alzheimer’s disease.”Dr. James Galvin, who was not involved: “A study like this is important because it demonstrates that there may be safe ways to increase drug delivery to the brain without any serious adverse effects. Focused ultrasound has been used in other treatment paradigms for brain diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and brain tumors.”
