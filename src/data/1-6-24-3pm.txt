Title: Scientists Worried About Mind Reading
Details: Neuroscientists are sounding the alarm on new devices that can quite literally read the thoughts of the wearer, emphasizing unintended consequences like mental surveillance.For example, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin successfully created a brain-computer interface in 2020 that can translate brain waves into text. When they realized the device was actually reading their thoughts, they were in disbelief."Holy shit," said neuroscientist Alexander Huth. "This is actually working."There have been reports since 2017 of other researchers creating devices that achieve a similar result. In January 2023, for instance, a team of Stanford scientists claimed to have tested a new brain-computer interface that can analyze brain activity and decode speech at up to 62 words per minute.To address concerns of surveillance, some experts have started proposing “neurorights,” or the right to mental privacy."The loss of mental privacy, this is a fight we have to fight today," said Columbia neuroscientist Rafael Yuste. “That could be irreversible. If we lose our mental privacy, what else is there to lose? That’s it, we lose the essence of who we are."Yuste founded an organization in 2017 dedicated to this mission. So far, the group has helped pass a constitutional amendment in Chile and petitioned the UN.

Title: Biden Calls Trump ‘Loser’
Details: Biden is starting off his 2024 re-election campaign by attacking Trump, labeling him a “loser” and likening his tactics to those of Nazi Germany.Biden, beginning his first 2024 campaign speech: “Today, we gather in a new year, some 246 years later, just one day before January 6 — a date forever seared in our memory because it was on that day that we nearly lost America, lost it all. Trump’s assault on democracy isn’t just part of his past, it’s what he’s promising for the future. He’s being straightforward. He’s not hiding the ball. His first rally for the 2024 campaign opened with a choir of January 6 insurrectionists singing from prison on a cellphone while images of the January 6 riot playing on the big screen behind him at his rally. Can you believe that? This was like something out of a fairy tale — a bad fairy tale.”Trump countered the claim by stating “because of his gross incompetence, Joe Biden is a true threat to democracy.”“This is not a time for us to have a mentally challenged president. The only insurrection is the insurrection that is taking place at our border where he is allowing millions of people from parts unknown to invade our country at a level far worse than even a military invasion.”Trump continued tearing into Biden during a campaign rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, mocking the president for “stuttering” and accusing him of “abusing George Washington’s legacy.”“Biden’s record is an unbroken streak of weakness, incompetence, corruption and failure, other than that he’s doing quite well, isn’t he? That’s a hell of a hell of a list, right? That’s why Crooked Joe is staging his pathetic, fear-mongering campaign event in Pennsylvania today. Did you see him? He was stuttering through the whole thing, he’s going, ‘He’s a threat to Democracy.’”“They’ve weaponized the government and he’s saying I’m a threat to democracy.”Trump is facing 91 charges and multiple states are attempting to pull him from the ballot for the upcoming presidential election.

Title: UK Navy Finds Top Job On Social Media
Details: The UK’s Royal Navy was forced to advertise for a top job on social media amid a recruitment crisis because Gen Z is not signing up.Military sources called the advertisement for an admiral position on LinkedIn “utterly shameful.” Another source said the advertisement was “unprecedented” and it was down to the Navy being unable to find a suitable candidate internally.Reportedly, the only person who applied when the position was first posted was an “unqualified weapons engineer commodore.” The chosen candidate would become the director of submarines and be responsible for “elite operations” and the nation’s nuclear deterrent.One user on LinkedIn was in such disbelief, commenting: “I’ll do it—but is the advertisement a scam. Surely not how the appointment is made.”Ben Wallace, the UK’s former defence secretary, said Britain needed to “do things differently” to recruit soldiers and other service members.“Armed forces across the West, not just Britain, across Europe, America have a recruitment challenge.

Title: Study: Hearing Aids Improve Lifespan
Details: New research from the University of Southern California indicates hearing aids may reduce mortality risk by 24%.The study analyzed data from nearly 10,000 adults and found regular hearing aid users had a significantly lower risk of death compared to non-users.Factors like degree of hearing loss, demographics, and medical history did not alter the observed reduction in mortality risk.The link between hearing aid use and longevity could be related to improved cognitive function, because hearing aids can decrease levels of depression and dementia.Dr. Janet Choi, the lead researcher: “These results are exciting because they suggest that hearing aids may play a protective role in people’s health and prevent early death.”
