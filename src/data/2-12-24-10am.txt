Title: People Are Making AI Clones Of Exes
Details: AI platforms like ChatGPT are being used to offer solace to those dealing with heartbreak, allowing users to create chatbots modeled after their ex-partners by analyzing the former partner’s texts and emails.One ChatGPT app called Talk to Your Ex, currently so popular that it has a waitlist, gives instructions on how to “import your ex’s chats into the app so you can still text/date her even though she dumped you.”Another app called Yodayo achieves a similar function. One user on Reddit shared their experience with the app: “My ex and I broke up after she had to move to another country for a job. I found out about this [character creator] AI chatbot platform called Yodayo through friends, and, at first, I was not interested. Then, with the many lonely nights I find myself in, I tried it out. I used their image generator and made an AI image of someone that sort of resembles her.”“I don't know how long I can play with this AI ex bot,” the user conceded to commenters urging them to move on. “I know I am lying to myself, but do you think I should text my ex? I really miss her.”

Title: Kamala Says She’s Ready To Serve
Details: Vice President Kamala Harris is emphasizing her readiness to serve and lead amid concerns over President Biden’s age and mental acuity.“I am ready to serve. There’s no question about that,” she told reporters, adding that everyone who sees her on the job “walks away fully aware of my capacity to lead.”The comment comes after a Department of Justice report last week found that Biden willfully retained and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen. It described the 81-year-old president’s memory as “hazy,” “fuzzy,” “faulty,” “poor” and having “significant limitations,” noting that Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice president.Hours after the report was released, the president insisted during a news conference that his memory was “fine,” and then misidentified Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as the leader of Mexico during the same briefing.

Title: Ancient Romans Used Psychedelics
Details: Researchers in the Netherlands have uncovered evidence that ancient Romans used Black henbane, a poisonous nightshade, as a hallucinogenic drug. The realization stems from Black henbane seeds being discovered in a hollowed animal bone.The seeds were found in various archeological sites throughout the Netherlands, including in a pot and a pit dating to the Roman era. This suggests the plant’s use was widespread during that time.The most compelling evidence of intentional use comes from a basket with cooking pots containing a complete flower head of Black henbane, interpreted as an “abandonment offering,” and a crafted bone containing up to 4000 seeds, sealed at one end.Ancient writers like Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder referenced Black henbane in their texts, noting its potent effects. Pliny distinguished between the plant’s black seeds, which could cause insanity, and white ones, which were used medicinally.

Title: NYC Has Least Agreeable People
Details: A new study has revealed significant personality differences among U.S. communities, with Manhattan having twice the percentage of open-minded people compared to Detroit.Conversely, Detroit’s residents are twice as likely to be conscientious, and people in Manhattan have the lowest proportion of agreeable people. San Antonio is the most agreeable.The findings suggest that people whose personalities align with their community’s dominant traits may enjoy better well-being, healthier lifestyles, and higher educational achievements than those who do not.Kevin Lanning, researcher: “Just as the ethnic character of a community can be described by proportions of different ethnic groups, the psychological character of a community may, perhaps, best be understood by a set of proportions of psychological types. To the extent that communities are diverse, people can ‘fit’ in multiple ways.”

Title: Body Tape Saves Designer’s Career
Details: In 2008, Joel Alvarez was living in his car and struggling to feed himself in what he described as “the lowest point of his existence.” 16 years later, he has traveled to 42 countries and worked with magazines like Maxim and Playboy because of the fashion line that he launched: Black Tape Project.The Miami-born designer has gone all in on body tape, ranging from hues of black, neon green, and baby pink, leaving very little to the imagination. At New York Fashion Week over the weekend, he showcased his fall 2024 collection, featuring models adorned solely in tape.Alvarez’s use of tape to compliment the body’s form began with taping nightclub dancers in Miami, developing techniques that ensured durability during performances. Now an established designer, he offers VIP experiences at his shows for $999 and sells his signature body tape online.Alvarez: “I've always been more of an artist than a businessman. And now I am a really good businessman because I learned the hard way. I remember having my friends tell me you have got to take your artist hat off and put your business hat on... But I don't want to stop being an artist and I don't want to change who I am and the way I think that my passion comes from my art, and the way I am comes a lot from the past that I have gone through.”

Title: Wearable Sticker Detects Body Failure
Details: MIT engineers have developed a wearable ultrasound sticker that can monitor organ stiffness, potentially indicating diseases such as liver and kidney failure or tumor growth.The sticker, about the size of a postage stamp, can continuously measure organ rigidity over 48 hours, as demonstrated in preliminary experiments on rats. The team aims to adapt the device for human use, envisioning applications in intensive care units for monitoring patients post-organ transplants.The technology uses advanced fabrication techniques to miniaturize ultrasound mechanisms, enabling the sticker to send and receive sound waves through the skin to assess organ health.Researchers are working on making the system portable and self-contained for home use, hoping it will revolutionize how organ health is tracked over time.Lead researcher: “We imagine that, just after a liver or kidney transplant, we could adhere this sticker to a patient and observe how the rigidity of the organ changes over days.”

Title: Smartphone Screen Becomes Speaker
Details: To simplify smartphones, some engineers envision the screen simultaneously serving as a speaker. The tech company Synaptics has created a new kind of screen that emits sound and provides touch feedback, paving the way for thinner gadgets.The technology, called piezoelectric transducers, works by applying an alternating voltage to ceramic materials, causing them to bend and vibrate. As a result, sound waves are produced directly from the screen for a more immersive audio experience.The innovation aims to replace traditional bulky speakers and haptic feedback mechanisms, eliminating the need for multiple components and allowing devices to be more compact.It’s expected to be integrated into some smartphones, wearables, and laptops by the end of 2024, marking a significant shift in device design and functionality.

Title: Wife Criticized For Hiring Hot Nanny
Details: A mom is standing her ground after social media users criticized her for hiring a “hot nanny,” pointing out that her husband is probably going to cheat.Katie, who shares a TikTok page with her husband Harry, posted a video of the lascivious nanny, Elsa, playing with her twins. The video gained two million views and tons of comments predicting infidelity.“I give 3 weeks until she finds her husband and the au pair cozied up in the bedroom,” one person commented. “100% chance husband is going to dump you for her. It’s coming,” a second person chimed in.Despite the hate, Katie continues to express trust in her husband and condemns the assumption that attractiveness dictates behavior. Her confidence and security have since garnered support from followers praising her stance.Katie: “I trust my husband implicitly. We actually have a really secure, amazing relationship. Just because I was beautiful and 21 does not mean that I was sleeping with married men.”

Title: Brazil Is Now 92% Renewable Energy
Details: Brazil has achieved a significant milestone this month by powering 92.4% of its electricity from renewable sources, its Ministry of Mines and Energy reported.The energy mix included a major portion of hydroelectric power, supplemented by wind, solar, and small-scale generation projects. Minister Alexandre Silveira praised the record, especially during a peak energy usage of 101,860 megawatts.As the world’s fifth-largest country by geographical size and population, Brazil’s focus on renewable energy has the potential to significantly impact global environmental dynamics.

Title: Man Smuggles 4 Mummified Monkeys
Details: A Boston man was caught smuggling four mummified monkeys from the Democratic Republic of Congo after a police dog named Buddy sniffed the “deceased and dehydrated” bushmeat in the man’s luggage.At first, the passenger claimed there was only dried fish in his luggage, and authorities believed him until Buddy sniffed out the truth. No charges were filed, but all material was seized, and the bushmeat was marked for destruction by the CDC.Boston’s area port director: “The potential dangers posed by bringing bushmeat into the United States are real. Bushmeat can carry germs that can cause illness, including the Ebola virus. The work of CBP’s K9 unit and Agricultural Specialist were vital in preventing this potential danger from entering the U.S.”
