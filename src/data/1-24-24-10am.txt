Title: Cryogenic Freezing Is Growing
Details: The number of “patients” is growing at the world’s largest cryogenic freezing facility, where scientists preserve dead bodies in the hopes that future advancements can revive them.The Cryonics Institute in Michigan freezes bodies, body parts, and pets at -320.8F after legal death, starting at $28,000. Those frozen include chefs, students, secretaries, and professors, and the oldest “patient” has been in cryo-suspension for over 40 years.The facility’s president, Dennis Kowalski views the facility with “awe and responsibility.” He believes future advancements could enable the reanimation of the clinically dead.Kowalski: “Ironically, while the number of members is growing, I’m only surprised that we’re not more popular. What we are doing is pretty rational when you think about it. Cryonics is like an ambulance ride to a future hospital that may or may not exist someday. While we give no guarantees, if you are buried or cremated your chances of coming back are zero. We are therefore a Pascal’s wager, or a gamble with little to lose and all to gain.”

Title: Jon Stewart Returns To ‘Daily Show’
Details: Jon Stewart is set to return to “The Daily Show,” which he hosted from 1999 to 2015.

Title: New Camera Reveals What Animals See
Details: Scientists have developed a groundbreaking camera system that allows humans to see the world as various animals do. This camera, with over 92% accuracy, replicates colors as animals perceive them.Animals have unique photoreceptors enabling them to see a range of colors from ultraviolet to infrared, including polarized light, which is invisible to humans. This diversity in vision means each animal has its own distinct color perception.The camera functions by recording videos across four color channels: blue, green, red, and ultraviolet. The footage is then processed to match the color perception of specific animals, like honeybees or UV-sensitive birds.Daniel Hanley, assistant professor at George Mason University: “We’ve long been fascinated by how animals see the world. Modern techniques in sensory ecology allow us to infer how static scenes might appear to an animal; however, animals often make crucial decisions on moving targets (e.g., detecting food items, evaluating a potential mate’s display, etc.). Here, we introduce hardware and software tools for ecologists and filmmakers that can capture and display animal-perceived colors in motion.”

Title: UK Warns Of Military Conscription
Details: A British army chief is warning that Brits could face a call-up if the UK goes to war with Russia, citing the military’s recruitment crisis.In a speech, General Sir Patrick Sanders emphasized the need for the UK to “mobilize the nation” and for the public to adopt a mindset of readiness to defend against foreign adversaries. He stressed he doesn’t support conscription but believes in the need for preparedness.“We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare—and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking,” he said. “Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.”The general’s comments come as the number of troops in the British Armed Forces has fallen to a record low, a trend also occurring in the U.S. To combat this crisis, the UK has resorted to exceptional measures, such as using social media to recruit for a top position that would handle nuclear operations.

Title: Saudi Opens First Alcohol Store
Details: Saudi Arabia has opened its first alcohol store to a select group of diplomats in its capital. This marks a significant change for the kingdom, where alcohol has been banned since 1952.The store, accessible only to non-Muslim officials, requires authorization through an app. Strict rules are in place, including a ban on photography and a monthly quota system for purchases.The move is part of Saudi Arabia's broader campaign to liberalize its society and attract more international tourists and expats. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative has been driving these reforms, which include allowing women to drive, opening movie theaters, and hosting concerts, while also maintaining a crackdown on political dissent.One consultant close to the Saudi government remarked: “It’s a baby step to opening up alcohol sales to non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia eventually, to hotels and other venues.”

Title: Canada Limiting Foreign Students
Details: Canada has announced a two-year cap on the number of foreign students attending universities to alleviate pressure on housing and healthcare.About 360,000 undergraduate study permits will be issued, with individual caps for each province and territory based on population. The government framed the limit as a way to benefit the current foreign student community: “In recent years, the integrity of the international student system has been threatened. Some institutions have significantly increased their intakes to drive revenues, and more students have been arriving in Canada without the proper supports they need to succeed.”The statement continued: “Rapid increases in the number of international students arriving in Canada also puts pressure on housing, health care, and other services. In the spirit of fairness, individual provincial and territorial caps have been established, weighted by population, which will result in much more significant decreases in provinces where the international student population has seen the most unsustainable growth.”

Title: Balmain Returns To Paris Menswear
Details: The Fall-Winter 2024 menswear shows in Paris saw the return of Balmain Homme after four years and Givenchy’s first collection since Matthew Williams’ departure. The event also featured the runway debut of fashion company 032c.At Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams showcased a collection reimagining the American Western wardrobe with hand-beaded motifs and tailored dungarees.

Models at Balmain Homme wore shiny black block-heeled boots encrusted with crystal detailing. On the other hand, Rick Owens presented oversized inflatable boots, while Timberland’s iconic six-inch yellow boots were a highlight, showcased at Louis Vuitton and Wales Bonner shows.Rick Owens said in his show notes: “Collection proportions are grotesque and inhuman in a howling reaction to some of the most disappointing human behavior we will witness in our lifetime. There is the eternal utopian hope of someplace better.”

Title: AI ‘Hallucinated’ Fake Legal Cases
Details: In a Canadian courtroom, lawyers discovered fake case law submitted by the opposing lawyer, marking Canada's first case of AI inventing fake legal cases. The attorney in question says she was unaware that AI chatbots like ChatGPT can be unreliable and did not check to see if the cases actually existed, leaving the courtroom in tears.The case involved a high-net-worth family matter, with the best interests of children at stake. Lawyer Chong Ke allegedly used ChatGPT to prepare legal briefs, but the AI “hallucinated” and produced fake cases that Ke then used as evidence.“The impact of the case is chilling for the legal community,” attorney Lorne MacLean said. “If we don’t fact-check AI materials and they are inaccurate it can lead to an existential threat for the legal system: people waste money, courts waste resources and tax dollars, and there is a risk that the judgments will be erroneous, so it’s a huge deal.”

Title: LA Times Slashes 20% Of Staff
Details: The Los Angeles Times is undergoing one of the most severe workforce reductions in its 142-year history as it faces a “financial crisis,” according to senior leadership. The layoffs will affect at least 115 journalists, over 20% of the newsroom.Union chief Matt Pearce described the layoffs as “devastating,” although the final number is lower than initially expected. High-profile layoffs include its Washington bureau chief and significant cuts to business and sports desks.Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of The Times, stated that the cuts are necessary due to the newspaper losing $30 to $40 million each year.The Los Angeles Times Guild: “This staffing cut is the fruit of years of middling strategy, the absence of a publisher, and no clear direction. But it’s clear that those entrusted to steward [the Soon-Shiong] family’s largesse have failed him—not the rank-and-file staff members with no say in editorial priorities.”

Title: Disney Pledges Affordable Housing
Details: Disney is committing to give $30 million for affordable housing to Anaheim, where Disneyland Resort is hosted. Another $8 million is designated for parks and funds for road improvements.City officials said Disney’s investment would be the largest corporate contribution to Anaheim for affordable housing. Last year, the city opened a 102-unit affordable housing apartment complex in the resort district that cost $61 million, which was backed in part by money from Disney.One council member, Natalie Rubalcava, wants more from Disney in the agreement. She said $8 million is not a lot of money for parks, and proposed Disney funding a few million dollars worth of affordable housing a year in perpetuity.
