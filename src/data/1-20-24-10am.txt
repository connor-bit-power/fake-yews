Title: Congressman: UFOs May Be Angels
Details: Republican Congressman Eric Burlison speculated on a podcast that UFOs might be “angels” or “extradimensional beings,” aligning with religious texts.Despite attending a classified briefing on UFOs, Burlison stated, “There’s nothing that’s been said that’s changed my worldview. I think the most likely explanation is that it’s manmade.”He went on to say: “I think it's more likely that it would be something extradimensional than it would be within this dimension. And then, so what I'll say is that when you start talking about things in that nature, that they're extradimensional, well, in a lot of different scriptures, including the Bible, and others, that's really the way that you describe messengers of God or, you know, angels.”Interestingly, Burlison may not be alone in thinking UFOs have a spiritual connection. The Daily Star claimed last year that commanders in the Pentagon halted UFO research “over fears aliens were demons,” citing lead UFO researcher Ron James. James said there’s “a very large contingent of people” in the U.S. government who align with Christian fundamentalism and actively oppose any research into extraterrestrial life.

And I asked him, 'Dude, when do you go?' And he goes, '11AM and 6PM.' And I was like, 'Are you fucking with me?’”“He won't ask anyone to do anything that he's not 1000% willing to do himself, twice as hard. And the idea is that this is a Spartan endeavor. And also, I think that Chris, from all the films that he's done, he deplores waste. He is a conservationist of the highest order,” the actor stated.So far, “Oppenheimer” has engulfed the awards season, already winning eight Critics Choice Awards and five Golden Globes.

I don't even need makeup. I just love applying it. I love my skincare routine. Sometimes I use Kosas facial spray. It smells really good. I don't really know what it does, but it probably doesn't need to do anything. I don't need my skincare routine, but I feel weird if I go to sleep without doing my skincare. It's so fun to do.”Any given evening, she says, she's likely to use a face wash, a facial scrub, a lip exfoliant, a hydrating serum, a moisturizer, a highlighting serum, an eyelash serum, and a lip mask.Another tween added: “What adults don't understand is that it's not even to look good. It's just really fun to have a routine and stick to it.”
