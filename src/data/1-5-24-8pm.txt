Title: Study: Average Surfer Saves 3 Lives
Details: A survey in New Zealand, a hotspot for surfing, found that surfers throughout their lives reportedly rescue an average of three people who are drowning or otherwise struggling in the water.The survey began with an online survey of 418 surfers from across New Zealand and revealed that some surfers have reported participating in 10 to 20 rescues. In total, the surfers claimed to have participated in 1,274 rescues, including 296 times when they felt they’d saved a person’s life. Of these rescues, 73% took place on beaches without lifeguards present.The research suggests that organizations involved in drowning prevention “should work closely with surfing communities on ways to reduce fatalities at coastal beaches.”Jamie Mead, researcher: “We need to get surfers the recognition they deserve and do more research to accurately quantify how many rescues they’re actually doing.”

Title: SCOTUS To Rule On Trump Ballot Ban
Details: The Supreme Court agreed to hear a case determining Trump's eligibility for the 2024 ballot, based on his alleged incitement of insurrection on January 6, 2021.The case is set for a fast-tracked hearing on February 8, prompted by Colorado and Maine's decisions to remove Trump from their primary ballots, citing the 14th Amendment's insurrection ban.Dozens of challenges nationwide argue Trump's actions qualify as insurrection, potentially barring him from federal office, though many have been dismissed in lower courts.The Colorado Supreme Court's 4-3 decision in December marks the first significant ruling against Trump's ballot eligibility, with all parties agreeing on the need for a national resolution.Steven Cheung, Trump campaign spokesman: “We welcome a fair hearing at the Supreme Court to argue against the bad-faith, election-interfering, voter-suppressing, Democrat-backed and Biden-led, 14th Amendment abusing decision to remove President Trump’s name from the 2024 ballot in the state of Colorado.”

Title: McDonald’s Faces Middle East Boycott
Details: McDonald's stance on the Israel-Hamas war has led to widespread boycotts in the Middle East and Muslim countries, with sales suffering.The boycotts were sparked after an Israeli McDonald's offered free meals to Israeli soldiers, a move that was renounced by McDonald's in some Muslim countries.In Malaysia, McDonald’s corporate is suing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement for defamation, claiming false statements linking the company to Israel's actions hurt their business.McDonald's reported an 8.3% increase in international sales in the third quarter of the last fiscal year but is expected to report losses in the next quarter due to the boycotts.Chris Kempczinski, president and CEO of McDonald’s: “Several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation. In every country where we operate, including in Muslim countries, McDonald’s is proudly represented by local owner-operators who work tirelessly to serve and support their communities while employing thousands of their fellow citizens.”

Title: USD Sees Best Start In Decade
Details: The U.S. dollar is seeing a significant surge at the beginning of 2024, marking its best start to a year in almost a decade.The currency saw a 0.7% rise to 102.3 on the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a rebound that followed a difficult period for the dollar. In late 2023, the USD declined due to the Fed’s indication of potential interest rate cuts.Analysts believe the surge is due to investors rethinking the Fed's rate-cut expectations and unwinding positions that were short on the U.S. dollar.Despite new gains, the dollar had a disappointing previous year, falling 2.1% after a significant rise in 2022, and reaching its highest level in over 20 years in September.

Title: Companies Rebrand DEI As ‘Wellbeing’
Details: U.S. companies are rebranding “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as “wellbeing and inclusion” because of the growing backlash against corporate America, with some Big Tech giants even cutting back diversity hiring programs.Analysts told Axios that the Supreme Court’s decision last summer to overturn affirmative action in higher education has resulted in businesses trying to avoid any programs that could draw legal scrutiny. “Anything that smacks of a quota” is out, said Diana Scott, Human Capital Center Leader at The Conference Board.“Companies are really starting to look at other ways to do the work without saying that they're doing the work,” noted Cinnamon Clark, cofounder of Goodwork Sustainability, a DEI consulting firm. Clark added that corporations will likely be talking more about "employee experience" or “wellness,” which falls under the inclusion bucket.Some have gone further than mere rebrandings. CNBC reported in December that Google and Meta have scaled back initiatives to recruit underrepresented groups. Google laid off DEI leaders who worked with its chief diversity officer, while Meta fired more than 60 workers who worked in a program to foster diversity in the company.

Title: Maximalist Design Fading In 2024
Details: Leading interior designers say 2024 interiors will be marked by a departure from maximalism and an emphasis on individualism, especially as a backlash against AI.Maximalism saw a surge in 2023, but it “now seems out of touch,” said interior designer Becky Carter. “Even the womb-like softness of the 1970s inspiration we've seen so much of is starting to feel heavy and overdone.”“There's a refreshing air to Halston-esque modernity: simple, unfussy materials, elegantly arranged, detailed, but without excess,” she added.Yohei Terui and Hiromu Yuyama from Japanese studio I IN echoed this sentiment: “Over the past couple of years, the theme has revolved around earthy color and simplicity through the use of natural materials.”They added that they “foresee a shift in direction, trending towards a more 'decorative' approach, in contrast to the previous style. We believe that this shift is driven by the prevailing desire of self-expression and individuality in today's culture.”Along the line of individualism, UK-based designer Tola Ojuolape emphasized the relationship interior design may have with AI this year: “Memorable and customized spaces that are not Pinterest- and AI-generated will be preferable, as the race against interior design and AI technology grows.”

Title: Millennials Choose Travel Over Kids
Details: Millennials say traveling is more important to them than advancing their careers, owning a home, becoming debt-free, or being in a relationship, a Business Insider survey found.49% of millennials surveyed said travel is an important goal for them in the next five years, which was a higher percentage than any other generation. Travel ranked above becoming debt-free (42%), advancing a career (41%), owning or renovating a home (38%), and starting or expanding a family (24%).Some online commentators see this trend as indicative of a culture that is placing less of an emphasis on children and family. With kids out of the equation, young Americans have more money to spend on themselves, with travel providing novelty and motivation to continue working.Carissa Boston, millennial traveler: “I worked two jobs. One job was to fund the traveling, and the other job was for the bills because it was something that I felt like I needed to do for a peace of mind.”
