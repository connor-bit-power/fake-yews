Title: Zuck Says Glasses Will Replace Phones
Details: In a new interview, Mark Zuckerberg said he expects smart glasses to be the mobile device of the future, while headsets will be the next laptop.Zuckerburg, in an interview with Morning Brew Daily: “I mean, I think that you can think of the glasses as the next computing generation’s phone, right? It’s the mobile, truly you're using it on the go computing platform. Whereas I think the headset is going to be more the next generation’s computer or TV screen. So the bigger screens that you have.”His comments come as Meta has engaged in both the smart glasses and headset market, partnering with Ray-Ban last year to offer stylish hi-tech glasses. Apple, on the other hand, has yet to release glasses, though there are rumors the company is considering them.Last week, Zuckerberg released a candid video comparing the Meta Quest 3, which is priced at $500, with Apple’s Vision Pro, which sells for seven times that at $3,500. The Facebook founder argued that his device offers a better quality product, especially when the price tag is accounted for.

Title: More Kids Are Using Psychiatric Drugs

The research, focusing on Medicaid patients under 17, found a 9.5% rise in the concurrent use of three or more psychiatric medication classes from 2015 to 2020.Particularly, foster care and disabled youths showed higher rates of multiple drug prescriptions. Research also found that in 2015, 40.7% of people aged two to 24 in the U.S. who took medication for ADHD also took a second psychiatric drug. That figure had risen from 26% in 2006.“The findings emphasize the importance of monitoring the use of psychotropic combinations, particularly among vulnerable populations, such as youths enrolled in Medicaid who have a disability or are in foster care,” researchers concluded.

Title: Wearable Sticker Detects Body Failure
Details: MIT engineers have developed a wearable ultrasound sticker that can monitor organ stiffness, potentially indicating diseases such as liver and kidney failure or tumor growth.The sticker, about the size of a postage stamp, can continuously measure organ rigidity over 48 hours, as demonstrated in preliminary experiments on rats. The team aims to adapt the device for human use, envisioning applications in intensive care units for monitoring patients post-organ transplants.The technology uses advanced fabrication techniques to miniaturize ultrasound mechanisms, enabling the sticker to send and receive sound waves through the skin to assess organ health.Researchers are working on making the system portable and self-contained for home use, hoping it will revolutionize how organ health is tracked over time.Lead researcher: “We imagine that, just after a liver or kidney transplant, we could adhere this sticker to a patient and observe how the rigidity of the organ changes over days.”

Title: Wife Criticized For Hiring Hot Nanny
Details: A mom is standing her ground after social media users criticized her for hiring a “hot nanny,” pointing out that her husband is probably going to cheat.Katie, who shares a TikTok page with her husband Harry, posted a video of the lascivious nanny, Elsa, playing with her twins.

Title: Brazil Is Now 92% Renewable Energy
Details: Brazil has achieved a significant milestone this month by powering 92.4% o its electricity from renewable sources, its Ministry of Mines and Energy reported.The energy mix included a major portion of hydroelectric power, supplemented by wind, solar, and small-scale generation projects. Minister Alexandre Silveira praised the record, especially during a peak energy usage of 101,860 megawatts.As the world’s fifth-largest country by geographical size and population, Brazil’s focus on renewable energy has the potential to significantly impact global environmental dynamics.

Title: Furniture Quality Is Garbage Now
Details: Furniture connoisseurs have noticed a decline in mass-market furniture quality, attributed to material innovation, cost-cutting, and changing consumer behaviors.Mike Coleman, owner of Big Mike’s Vintage: “I would bet all the money in my pocket that any furniture you buy on Amazon today will not last more than five years, especially if it says ‘made in China.’”CoCo Ree Lemery, furniture designer: “It’s every component that then combines together to make something that is fundamentally less durable.”Engineered wood products like medium-density fiberboard have replaced solid hardwood or plywood, contributing to the decline in furniture durability, experts note. Consumer demand for fast, cheap, and trendy furniture has influenced manufacturers to prioritize cost over quality, leading to a rise in “fast furniture.”

Title: Dogs Receive ‘Elixir Of Life’
Details: Clinical trials have begun for the first anti-aging pill for dogs, aiming to extend the lives of older canines by at least an extra year. The hope is that if this revolutionary drug succeeds, it could pave the way for lifespan-extending drugs for humans.The trials will involve 1,000 dogs over ten years old, weighing at least 14 pounds, monitored over four years to assess lifespan and quality of life improvements.Loyal, the San Francisco startup behind the pill, is seeking FDA approval for a chewable version and an injectable alternative for large dogs, with a target of early 2025 for conditional approval.Researchers have discovered that dogs experience similar environmental conditions to humans and appear to have similar age-related dynamics with disease risk, allowing them to serve as a model for longevity.
