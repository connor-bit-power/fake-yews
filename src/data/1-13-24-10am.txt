Title: U.S. Sees ‘Autism Tsunami’
Details: A new study analyzes the significant increase in U.S. autism cases, which the study authors describe as an “autism tsunami.”According to the CDC, one out of every 36 children now has autism, a surge from one out of 110 children in 2006. This new study found that the societal costs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) could rise to $589 billion annually by 2030, $1.36 trillion per year by 2040, and $5.54 trillion by 2060 without preventative measures.The authors concluded that rising autism rates must be taken seriously as a public health and economic policy issue. “Paradoxically, the future costs of autism loom so large that, rather than responding with a sense of urgency as one might expect, policymakers thus far have generally failed to engage with the policy implications at all,” they wrote.Notably, the researchers didn’t investigate why the U.S. autism rate is increasing. The CDC says the surge is due to a greater awareness of ASD and better testing, while others, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claim some vaccines cause autism.

Title: Cockpit Window Crack Found Mid-Air
Details: A Boeing aircraft in Japan was forced to turn back after a crack was found in the cockpit window. This comes just one week after a Boeing jet in the U.S. had a door detach while passengers were 16,000 feet in the air.This time, the aircraft was a Boeing 737-800, which isn’t part of the 737 Max 9 series that experienced the door ejection. After the incident last week, the U.S. grounded all 171 Max 9 jets for safety inspections. United Airlines reported that some had loose bolts, without disclosing how many.There were no injuries among the 59 passengers and six crew members on the Japan flight, and the crack did not affect the flight's control or pressurization.

Title: 9 States May Ban Homeless From Public
Details: The Supreme Court is considering whether cities in nine states are allowed to ban the homeless from sleeping in public areas after a lower court declared the move unconstitutional.Citing cruel and unusual punishment, a circuit court restricted interventions in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. California Governor Gavin Newsom has asked the Supreme Court to review the issue, which he has promised he will “own” as his state invests billions to address homelessness.“California has invested billions to address homelessness, but rulings from the bench have tied the hands of state and local governments to address this issue,” he said on Friday. “The Supreme Court can now correct course and end the costly delays from lawsuits that have plagued our efforts to clear encampments and deliver services to those in need.”

Title: AI Baristas, Chefs Stir Concerns
Details: At last week’s CES tech event in Las Vegas, AI-driven robots, including a skilled barista robot, showcased the rapid advancement in AI and robotics.Roman Alejo, barista: “It is very scary because tomorrow is never promised. A lot of AI is coming into this world. It is very scary and very eye-opening to see how humans can think of replacing other humans.”The robot barista was shown tipping the jug of milk over a latte, pouring slowly at first, then lifting and tilting the jug like a choreographed dance. Another showcase had chef-like robots teasing a future with “autonomous restaurants,” as one company put it.Experts note that labor unions are increasingly focusing on job security in negotiations, as AI poses a threat to roles that lack customer interaction. “Technology was a strike issue and one of the very last issues to be resolved,” said Ted Pappageorge, the Culinary Workers Union's secretary-treasurer.Despite some industry claims that AI is filling labor shortages rather than replacing jobs, workers and unions remain apprehensive about the future of employment in the face of rapidly evolving technology.

Title: Scientists Debunk Mexican Aliens
Details: In September 2023, a ufologist presented corpses that allegedly belonged to aliens to Mexico’s Congress. Scientists now say the figures were simply made of paper, glue, metal, and human and animal bones.The two-foot-long dolls featured “very poorly” built three-fingered hands and elongated heads, resembling extraterrestrial beings, experts said.Flavio Estrada, forensic archaeologist: “The conclusion is simple: they are dolls assembled with bones of animals from this planet, with modern synthetic glues, therefore they were not assembled during pre-Hispanic times. They are not extraterrestrials; they are not aliens.”Back in September, ufologist José Jaime Maussan hyped up the discovery, claiming the bodies were between 700 and 1,800 years old. “This is the first time it (extraterrestrial life) is presented in such a form and I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world,” he said.

Title: China Beats Japan As Top Car Exporter
Details: China is expected to emerge as the world’s top auto exporter in 2023, surpassing traditional heavyweights Japan and Germany.Geopolitical shifts, especially the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have significantly boosted China's auto exports, particularly to Russia. Chinese car manufacturers now command 55% of the Russian market, a substantial increase from the 8% they held in 2021. In the first 11 months of 2023, China exported 5.26 million vehicles, mainly to Russia and Mexico.Despite its lead in electric vehicles, China's current export growth is largely driven by traditional gas-powered automobiles. Still, Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD are expanding rapidly overseas, indicating a future rise in China's EV exports.Michael Dunne, automotive consultant: “Never before have we seen automakers from a single country gobble up so much market share so quickly—the Chinese came into a windfall.”

We have proved we can survive through anything.”Serhiy Fedorchenko, food supply warehouse manager: “The Japanese don't know what we put in our sushi,” he jokes, nodding to stacked buckets of cream cheese in what they've dubbed the sushi corner of their warehouse, “But people like it, so it's good for business.”Soldiers especially appreciate the peace found in the restaurants. “We are living human beings. It's very important to be able to come back [from the front lines] and have something from our normal life. Such dinners unite us,” one artilleryman said.
