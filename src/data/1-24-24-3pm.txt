Title: Kobe Beef Has 43-Year Waiting List
Details: A butcher shop in Japan has a 43-year-long waiting list for its “Extreme Croquette,” a potato and Kobe beef-filled snack.The croquettes, made with A5 Kobe beef and Red Andes potatoes, are sold online domestically in Japan for $3.64 each. 63,000 people are currently waiting.Shigeru Nitta, the third-generation owner of Asahiya: “We made affordable and tasty croquettes that demonstrate the concept of our shop. We started selling them because we wanted people to have a taste of high-quality, diced Kobe beef and to encourage them to buy other cuts of beef from us. I feel sorry for having them wait.”Despite their popularity, producing these croquettes resulted in a financial loss for Nitta, who initially limited production to manage costs.Nitta views the croquettes as an investment to attract customers to buy premium beef online, despite the long wait times extending into the 2060s.
