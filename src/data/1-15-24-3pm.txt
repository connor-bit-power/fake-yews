Title: Trillionaire Expected Within Decade
Details: The world could see the first trillionaire within ten years, according to anti-poverty organization Oxfam International.Amitabh Behar, Interim Executive Director of Oxfam: “We have the top five billionaires, they have doubled their wealth. On the other hand, almost 5 billion people have become poorer. Very soon, Oxfam predicts that we will have a trillionaire within a decade. Whereas to fight poverty, we need more than 200 years.”Oxfam said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which sent energy and food costs soaring, disproportionately hit the poorest nations.Oxfam emphasizes the urgent need for effective taxation of the wealthiest and corporations to address growing global inequality.Measures like permanent taxation of the ultra-rich in every country are proposed as part of an “inequality-busting” agenda, especially relevant as Brazil hosts this year's G20 summit.

Title: Walmart Taps Into Streetwear
Details: Designer Darryl Brown has entered into a significant partnership with Walmart.Brown has worked with his partner Destanie Rodriguez to design a Midwest Kids capsule collection for Walmart centered around planting seeds and giving flowers.The collection, available online and in 700 Walmart stores, includes a Midwest Kids logo T-shirt ($10), a graphic T-shirt featuring florals designed by Rodriguez with a “Planting Seeds and Giving Flowers Daily” graphic on the chest ($10), and a Midwest Kids graphic hoodie and matching joggers with floral details ($20). A varsity jacket and bucket hat will be available on NTWRK via a $1 drawing.Brown: “For me, it's like a dream come true in a lot of ways. Walmart is a huge heritage brand. It's a huge conglomerate. It’s not even a household name brand. It is a way of life brand. So many people go to Walmart. Walmart is like air almost. It seems weird to be getting flowers. A lot of the guys never even had flowers given to them. Most people want to give you flowers after you die and say, ‘We need to lift him up and he’s amazing.’ But we wanted to take it a step further. While people are alive, let's give them flowers. And then at the same time, we're also planting seeds.”

As a freshman at the Academy, you might have a hard time finding your identity in a very new and challenging environment. My cousin had competed in pageants for a long time, and one of the big things about it that I love is the community service aspect and the focus on public speaking. It's an awesome experience to bring both sides of the favorite parts of my life together and hopefully make a difference for others to be able to realize that you don't have to limit yourself.”Arkansas State Representative Steve Womack: “Congratulations to Fort Smith's Madison Marsh who was just crowned Miss America 2024!!!

Her remarkable strength and story will be an inspiration for young women all across America!”
