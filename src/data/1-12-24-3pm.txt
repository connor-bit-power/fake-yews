Title: Brazil Uses Drones To Save Forests
Details: Rio de Janeiro has launched a high-tech reforestation initiative using drones to disperse seeds in hard-to-reach areas. This project is in collaboration between the city hall and startup Morfo and started last Friday.The drones are equipped to disperse 180 seed capsules per minute, making the process 100 times faster than traditional hand seeding methods.The areas for seeding are selected after analyzing soil and native species, with AI-powered computers determining the specific targets and number of seeds.This approach not only speeds up reforestation but also eliminates the months-long process of nurturing seedlings and transporting them to planting sites.The project is part of Rio de Janeiro's effort to enhance its green spaces and restore local native species in one of the most-visited cities in the Americas.
