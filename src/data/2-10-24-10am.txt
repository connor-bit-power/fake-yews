Title: French Village: Don’t Swipe In Public
Details: A French village has voted to ban people from scrolling on their phones in public.Adults and children are now prohibited from scrolling on their devices while walking down the street, sitting with others on a park bench, while in shops, cafes, or eating in restaurants, and while parents wait for their children in front of the school gates. Those who might check their phone’s map when lost are instead being encouraged to ask for directions.The village, home to less than 2,000 people, has also approved a law for families on children’s use of screens: no screens of any kind in the morning, no screens in bedrooms, and no screens before bed or during meals. If parents of teens sign an agreement not to give their child a smartphone before the age of 15, the town hall will provide the child with an old-fashioned handset for calls only.Paul-Petit, the mayor: “I want to preserve public spaces from the smartphone invasion. It’s not about banning all phones, it’s about proposing that people abstain from getting out their smartphones to scroll social media, play a game, or watch videos in public places, which we want to preserve for social life.”

Title: Christopher Nolan Banned Uggs On Set
Details: In a new interview, Christopher Nolan confirmed his distaste for actors wearing Uggs on set, calling the footwear a “distraction.”Nolan: “Ah, the Uggs controversy. I try to minimize distractions. Even though we're all engaged in this absurd process where this wall is real, but there's lights and a guy with a microphone, you're asking the actor to focus in on the reality. So everything you can do—like wearing the correct shoes, or, whatever, not changing your trousers… Anything we can do to keep that reality, that bubble, intact.”Last summer, “Oppenheimer” star Emily Blunt first let slip about the legendary filmmaker’s attitude toward the sheepskin boots: “I’ve never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan. It’s a testament to how he wants everything on set to look as it would [in the period]. If there’s a plastic bottle in the shot, he’s like, ‘Ugh!’ He hates to even look at it. I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I’d just get this withering look down to my feet—it was like being in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ again.”
