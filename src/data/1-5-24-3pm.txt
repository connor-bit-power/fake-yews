Title: Pornhub Blocked In 2 More States
Details: Pornhub has blocked access in North Carolina and Montana to protest new state laws that prevent minors from accessing the websites.The two states passed legislation that requires any company distributing sexually explicit material to verify that the viewer is 18 years or older by using a “commercially available database.” For instance, some age verification software asks users to hold their driver’s license up to a web camera so it can be compared to a live image of their face.If users in these states attempt to access Pornhub, they will be greeted with a video with adult video star Cherie DeVille explaining why they can't use it, as well as a written statement.Statement: “While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit and adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk. In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we've seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.”North Carolina and Montana join a growing list of states that have restricted access to online porn: Louisiana, Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Utah. Legislators supporting these measures point to research that indicates more than half of U.S. teenagers report seeing online pornography by the time they are 13.
