Title: Ozempic Is Freaking Out Food CEOs
Details: CEOs of everything from snack food to knee implants are growing increasingly concerned about the weight-loss drug Ozempic, contacting the drugmaker themselves to receive reassurance that their profits will not be hurt.The CEO of Novo Nordisk, the company behind the drug, said during an interview: “A couple of CEOs from, say, food companies have been calling me.” He declined to name names, saying questions had centered on how the drugs work and how fast they would roll out. “They are scared about it.”Some companies, like Walmart, have publicly voiced concerns. The retail corporation said last October that Ozempic is making customers purchase less food, citing anonymized data. Chipotle, meanwhile, believes fresh food will still appeal to people who are trying to lose weight.Sean Connolly, CEO of packaged goods giant Conagra Brands, said the snackmaker has “an entire department of demand scientists” studying changes in consumer behavior every day.“There’s still so many unknowns regarding the rate of adoption, the impact on food choices,” Hershey’s Co. CEO said on a call last year. “We’re doing more work constantly to understand those future potential impacts on our categories.”

Title: Sports Betting Booms Amid Loneliness
Details: Young men on college campuses are increasingly turning to sports betting to form friendships and combat loneliness.One student, 19-year-old Marcus, told Business Insider he’s made more than $32,000 after pouring in $11,000 of his own money. “Sports betting, oddly enough, has kept my friendships alive,” he emphasized.Marcus said he’s encouraged other young men to join, and they now wake up at 4 or 5AM to catch tennis matches to bet on. He pointed out that the hobby’s ability to create and deepen friendships is one of the main reasons he does it, and that he and his friends will spend their earnings on a trip to Cancún, Mexico.Nationwide, sports betting has surged on campuses. Some apps now allow anyone over 18 to bet because they’re modeled after sweepstakes and aren’t subject to conventional betting laws that set the minimum age at 21. Other students use VPNs to get around state laws.Noah, a 19-year-old who goes to college in Illinois, uses sports betting to keep up with his friends from high school. “With some of my home friends, it's a great way to be communicating throughout the week,” he said. "Honestly, I'd feel kind of like a degenerate if I just did it by myself," said 21-year-old Miles.Experts caution this hobby could easily devolve into an addiction. Still, it comes at a time when loneliness is higher than ever, especially among young men, providing an unconventional avenue for friendship.

Title: Students Are Simply Bored At School
Details: Researchers have found that boredom in exams significantly affects student performance. This is the first study to closely examine boredom in exam environments, involving 1,820 German students from 5th to 10th grade.The study revealed that high levels of boredom were more likely when the exam lacked personal relevance to the students. This boredom was also linked to a negative effect on exam results.The “abundance” hypothesis proposed by the researchers suggests that boredom arises when students are over-challenged (the test is too hard) or under-challenged (the test is too easy). Over-challenging leads to lower grades due to cognitive resource consumption.Educational psychologist Thomas Götz: “In order to combat test boredom, teachers should prepare exam tasks in such a way that they relate to the reality of students' lives and are not very under-challenging or over-challenging.”

Title: Trader Joe’s Food May Contain Rocks
Details: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a health alert for Trader Joe’s Chicken, Lentil & Caramelized Onion Pilaf due to reports of rocks found in the product.Produced between November 1, 2023, and January 19, 2024, the frozen ready-to-eat meal has prompted multiple consumer complaints, including one report of a dental injury caused by the alleged foreign material.Although a formal recall was not issued, the product is no longer available for sale in stores. Trader Joe’s has advised customers to discard or return the product for a full refund.The pilaf included saffron basmati rice, dark chicken meat, dates, and golden raisins, packaged in a 14-ounce plastic container.

Title: China Bets Big On Middle East Tech
Details: A Chinese venture capital firm backed by Saudi Arabia is planning to raise $1 billion to support technology startups in the Middle East. The move is the latest in China’s efforts to upset American influence by forming closer ties with nations already skeptical of the West.The firm, MSA Capital, is currently in talks with regional investors to finalize plans to launch the fund within the year. It would become the largest VC firm focused on the Middle East if it successfully raises the targeted amount.Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has been actively investing in tech firms and startups, reflecting the country’s efforts in diversifying its economy. Startups in the Kingdom raised $1.4 billion in 2023, putting it ahead of its main competitor, the UAE, for the first time.

Title: Cloned Monkey Survives For 2 Years
Details: The longest-lived cloned primate in the world has survived for over two years.Two years ago, scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully cloned a rhesus macaque with the same technique used to clone Dolly the sheep in 1996. This method involves taking DNA from something like a skin cell from a normal grown monkey and then injecting it into an embryo that has had its own DNA removed. The embryo is then carried to term by a surrogate.Dr. Qiang Sun, who created the first successful monkey clones in 2018, said he managed to develop a healthier placenta that improved the latest creature’s development. He claims the team has “improved the efficiency” of cloning monkeys, which they hope can one day be used for lab research, calling the success “remarkable.”Despite this achievement, the process remains controversial and challenging, with a low success rate of one successful birth from 113 attempts.

Title: Gen Z Splurging On Luxury To Cope
Details: Young Americans are spending more than they probably should on luxury goods as a way to soothe their economic despair.For instance, Nia Holland, 24, told Bloomberg she spent $2,500 on a vintage Chanel bag because “the economy sucks, there’s global warming, there’s constant political and social unrest globally. It’s just easier to spend money on things that will bring you immediate fulfillment.” Holland is getting financial support from her family as she pursues a doctorate in education and psychology.People are increasingly spending during uncertain times, figuring their financial futures are doomed no matter what. About 27% of Americans admit to “doom spending” to cope with concerns about the economy and foreign affairs. The rates are even higher among Millennials and Gen Z, at 43% and 35% respectively. Higher student debt loads, an increased cost of living, and shifts in the labor market have all exacerbated this trend.

Title: Number Of Relatives Are Declining
Details: A new study suggests that families will change dramatically over the years to come, with a decline of over 35% in the number of relatives per individual.This change is attributed to shifting family structures, with fewer cousins, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren but more great-grandparents and grandparents.In 1950, a 65-year-old woman had an average of 41 living relatives. By 2095, a woman of the same age will have an average of only 25 living relatives.The largest declines in family size are expected in South America and the Caribbean, with a 67% decrease in relatives for a 65-year-old woman by 2095. In North America and Europe, the decline is less pronounced but still significant.Diego Alburez-Gutierrez, researcher: “Our findings confirm that the availability of kinship resources is declining worldwide. As the age gap between individuals and their relatives widens, people will have family networks that are not just smaller, but also older.”

Title: Kids Now Think Driving Is Lame
Details: Gen Z is less interested in driving than previous generations, with only 25% of 16-year-olds and 45% of 17-year-olds holding a driver's license. In 1997, 43% of 16-year-olds and 62% of 17-year-olds were already on the road.Analysts suggest this trend might be due to environmental concerns, with the youth favoring sustainable transport options like public transit, ride-sharing, or e-scooters.One mother posted online: “I have a 21-year-old nephew who still has no plans on driving. And [my] 13-year-old [son]—I have a truck out front for him [when he’s old enough]—and he said, ‘I don’t need that. You’re gonna drive me or I’ll call an Uber.’”

Title: Christian Bale Building Foster Homes
Details: Christian Bale is creating a village in California to support foster children, the first of its kind in the state. The $22 million project includes 12 foster homes and facilities for independent living, aiming to keep siblings together.The village will also feature a 7,000-square-foot community center, serving as a hub for fostering connections and support among the residents.Bale’s inspiration comes from personal experiences and a desire to address the trauma faced by children separated from their families. His project is expected to be completed in 2025 and is located in Palmdale, near Los Angeles.Christian Bale: “Imagine the absolute pain and the trauma of losing your parents or being torn from your parents, and then losing your brothers and sisters on top of that. That’s no way to treat kids. And so, we will be the hub for that. I hope that this village will be the first of many, and I hope that people, Californians and Angelenos, know to come join us in opening our eyes to what’s happening right under our noses. These are our children, and we must help our children.”He continued: “I grew up with a dad who was always very active and altruistic, and we would be headed to protests and shouting at Maggie Thatcher and stuff. As a kid, I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I loved it, and I just admired the hell out of my dad in that way that he went out of his way to care for other people. We were always having other people coming and living in our house who didn’t have homes, etc. That’s just the guy that he was.”
