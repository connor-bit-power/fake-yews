Title: Thieves Steal 96 Bee Hives
Details: Nearly 100 bee hives worth $34,000 in total were stolen from almond orchards in California during the crucial almond blossom season. This incident affected both local and out-of-state beekeepers who depend on the pollination of crops during this peak time.The Fresno County Sheriff’s Office and local police are offering a cash reward for information leading to the recovery of the stolen hives, urging residents to report any suspicious activities involving bee hive transportation.Fresno County Sheriff's Office spokesperson: “This type of crime consistently happens in Fresno County around January and February as bee hives are set out for the almond bloom. They will strike at night when the bees [are] dormant or in the rain when they are not active.”County Farm Bureau CEO: “You’re looking at hundreds and hundreds of dollars invested in that single hive, and you just don't make that up. You don't just go buy another box, and all of a sudden have a colony.”

Title: DOJ Says Biden Has ‘Faulty Memory’
Details: Biden insisted his memory is “fine” at an impromptu White News news conference yesterday, criticizing a new report from the Justice Department on his handling of classified information.The report, which found evidence that the president willfully retained and shared highly classified information when he was a private citizen, described the 81-year-old Democrat’s memory as “hazy,” “fuzzy,” “faulty,” “poor” and having “significant limitations.” It noted that Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice president.During the news conference, Biden said: “I’m well-meaning, and I’m an elderly man and I know what the hell I’m doing. I’ve been president, and I’ve put this country back on its feet. I don’t need his recommendation. The fact is, they made a firm conclusion: I did not break the law. Period. How the hell dare he raise that, I don’t need anyone to remind me of when he passed away.”He continued: “My memory is fine, I’m the most qualified person in this country to be President of the United States and finish the job I started. It wasn’t out like in Mar-a-Lago, in a public place.”During that same conference, he misidentified Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as the leader of Mexico.

Title: World’s First Flying Coin Has Engine
Details: Poland has engineered the world’s first levitating, glow-in-the-dark coin. It has been named the UFO MP-1766, for Cameroon, making it legal tender worth 1,766 Cameroonian francs, or approximately $2.90.The coin features a hidden motor and a specially designed base that generates a magnetic field, allowing it to float in the air. Its unique glow comes from fluorescent paint hardened with UV light.Mint of Poland’s Director of the Technical and Production: “We cannot simply create a coin that goes into official circulation, because only central banks have the right to issue money.

Title: U.S. Could Have 1,000s Of Ghost Towns
Details: New research predicts that around 15,000 U.S. cities could experience significant depopulation by the year 2100, effectively turning them into ghost towns.Depopulation trends are influenced by various factors, such as the decline of industry, lower birth rates, and the impacts of climate change. The Northeast and Midwest are likely the most affected, with Vermont and West Virginia projected to see over 80% of their cities shrinking.The study highlights the need for a shift from growth-based urban planning to adapting for cities facing population decline.Sybil Derrible, senior author and urban engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago: “The way we’re planning now is all based on growth, but close to half the cities in the U.S. are depopulating. The takeaway is that we need to shift away from growth-based planning, which is going to require an enormous cultural shift in the planning and engineering of cities.”Justin Hollander, an urban planning scholar at Tufts University: “I have never seen a national study that looked so far into the future. Depopulation is everywhere, and the paper is right to demand that cities face this fact and begin to honestly prepare for this possible future.”

The removal was influenced by the leader’s posts praising attacks in southern Israel and supporting Palestinian resistance against Israel, as well as attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.Mohammad Marandi, academic and former Iranian government advisor: “Many thousands of Iranians, including myself, have had their Facebook and Instagram accounts suspended or deleted. So this isn't unexpected. Ayatollah Khamenei is the only world leader that supports and empowers the resistance in Palestine. That is his crime.”

Title: EU Surrenders To Farmers
Details: Following weeks of road blockades and tractor sieges by farmers across Europe, the EU has revised its 2040 climate change proposal, removing mandates for a 30% cut in agricultural production and lifestyle changes for citizens.Farmers have been protesting the EU’s green policies, which include diesel subsidy cuts. The new draft highlights the importance of agriculture in the EU’s food sovereignty and seeks a balanced approach to climate action, emphasizing positive opportunities for farmers rather than viewing them as adversaries.European Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra: “We need to make sure we have a balanced approach.
