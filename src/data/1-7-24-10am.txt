Title: U.S. Secretly Met COVID ‘Batwoman’
Details: U.S. researchers secretly met with a Chinese scientist who ran experiments at the laboratory suspected of triggering COVID, newly obtained documents reveal. The goal of the meeting was for the scientist to receive backing for a project that would go on to supercharge coronaviruses—shortly before the devastating outbreak started in her native Wuhan.Nicknamed “Batwoman,” Shi Zhengli met with scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in 2017. Analysts say this revelation will bolster fears that the West knowingly collaborated in experiments that may have produced one of the world’s deadliest pandemics.In February 2023, the U.S. Energy Department concluded that an accidental laboratory leak in China most likely caused COVID, though U.S. spy agencies remain divided over the origins of the virus.

Title: Microsoft Poised To Overtake Apple
Details: The competition between Microsoft and Apple is heating up again for the title of the world's most valuable company, with only a $100 billion gap between them. This is the smallest difference seen in over two years.Apple dethroned Microsoft in 2010 with a $222 billion market cap. Both have since taken turns leading, with Apple reaching a $2 trillion cap in August 2020, followed by Microsoft in June 2021.In 2023, Microsoft’s stock rose 57%, outpacing Apple's 48% increase. Analysts attribute this to Microsoft's diverse portfolio, like Office 365, and Copilot, its new AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Copilot represented the company’s “iPhone moment,” claiming it will revolutionize Microsoft’s entire ecosystem.Apple, however, has seen a drop in its shares due to weaker iPhone demand and a lack of compelling new features in the upcoming iPhone 16, as per Barclays. Analysts also note that while Apple has a long history with AI under the name Machine Learning, it hasn’t launched a ChatGPT-style service, which may impact its position against Microsoft.

Title: Prince Andrew Refuses Royal Oust
Details: Prince Andrew is refusing to leave Royal Lodge despite new claims about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein and alleged sexual misconduct, sources tell The Mirror. He has a “cast iron lease” and has vowed to stay put.King Charles is reportedly keen to move Andrew to Frogmore Cottage and is considering withdrawing funding for Andrew's security at Royal Lodge to distance himself from the controversy.Newly unsealed documents last week have reshifted focus on Andrew's alleged involvement with Epstein's activities, including “acts of sexual abuse” and participation in an “underage orgy.” Andrew has consistently denied all allegations against him.Amidst the turmoil, Andrew is said to be emotionally overwhelmed, "devastated," and has "no idea how to respond" to the ongoing accusations.A source close to Andrew told The Mirror: “Andrew is going nowhere. The King can't force him out. He has a cast iron lease that he has absolutely every intention of honoring.”Another source told The Daily Mail: “When it comes to any public role for his brother, there is no way back. There has always been an agreement that Andrew would be permitted to attend private and family events, as is his right. But not public or official ones. That has not changed.”

Title: Wall Street Buying Homes Amid Lack
Details: A Wall Street-backed landlord has purchased nearly 300 Las Vegas homes for $98 million, all while Sin City has the worst shortage of affordable housing in the country.Invitation Homes, based in Dallas, bought 264 homes in Vegas, property records show. The firm now owns 3,500 homes in Clark County, making it the second-largest owner of single-family rental homes.This comes as the Nevada city struggles with an acute shortage of housing. Las Vegas has only 14 units available for every 100 extremely low-income households, for instance. Eviction filings in Vegas have also increased by 35% from 2019 to 2021, contributing to a deeper homelessness crisis.The Vegas purchase is part of a larger $650 million deal involving nearly 1,900 single-family rental homes, making Invitation Homes a major player in the U.S. housing market. A new analysis finds that firms like Invitation Homes could own up to 40% of all U.S. homes by 2030.

Title: Americans Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’
Details: The popularity of “buy now, pay later” loans has surged, particularly during the holiday season, with a 14% year-over-year increase. Analysts are calling these loans “phantom debt” because they are not monitored by any central database, meaning Americans could be worse off financially than it seems.Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo: “Because no central repository exists for monitoring, growth of this ‘phantom debt’ could imply total household debt levels are actually higher than traditional measures. With credit card interest rates north of 20%, a ‘buy now, pay later loan’ affords consumers access to capital without increased costs. You can bury yourself in low monthly payments.”Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate: “It’s hard to know how much of this debt is out there. It's this kind of shadow debt that's hanging over people.”The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has opened an inquiry into lenders of these loans, focusing on the transparency of loan terms, consumer debt accumulation, applicable consumer protection laws, and data harvesting practices.

Title: DeSantis May Drop Out Next Week
Details: There are strong indications that DeSantis may withdraw from the presidential race if he loses to Trump in the upcoming Iowa caucuses on January 15.Sources close to the DeSantis campaign, including a major donor and a high-level political operative, believe he will begrudgingly endorse Trump.Trump's growing support is evident from recent endorsements from significant Republican figures like House Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Senator Tom Cotton.DeSantis' potential decision stems from current polling numbers showing Trump with a substantial lead nationally and specifically in Iowa. The RealClearPolitics national polling average has Trump at 62.7%, with former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley at 11% and DeSantis at 10.9%. Within the state of Iowa Trump is at 51.3%, with DeSantis 33 points behind.

Title: European Union Army Proposed
Details: Italy’s foreign minister is advocating for a unified European army, emphasizing its importance for effective European foreign policy and peacekeeping.In an interview with an Italian newspaper, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said: “If we want to be peacekeepers in the world, we need a European military. And this is a fundamental precondition to be able to have an effective European foreign policy. In a world with powerful players like the United States, China, India, Russia—with crises from the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific—Italian, German, French or Slovenian citizens can only be protected by something that already exists, namely the European Union.”The idea of enhanced European defense cooperation has gained traction since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sparking debates on the EU's role in global security.

Title: Surge In People Living In Cars
Details: In states like California and Washington, a dramatic increase in people living in vehicles has been observed, prompting some cities to develop “safe parking lots.”For instance, a 2018 survey of King County, Washington, showed that 3,372 people were living in their cars, a 46% increase from the year before. In 2019, San Francisco saw a 45% increase from its count in 2017; in nearby Oakland, vehicle-based homelessness more than doubled in the same period.Berkeley, California, has implemented a “safe parking lot” in response to this growing trend, providing a hub for about 40 motorhomes and RVs. The initiative was jumpstarted by a local non-profit to help “alleviate the crisis of unsheltered and encampment homeless” in one of the nation’s most expensive housing markets.In nearby Santa Barbara, the non-profit New Beginnings has advocated for “safe parking lots” since 2004. The group has since expanded to 154 spaces across 26 lots and has consulted with over 300 communities.While safe lots provide crucial temporary relief and community for residents, the ultimate goal is to transition people into more stable housing, advocates emphasize.

Title: East Coast Is Sinking
Details: The U.S. Atlantic Coast is sinking by several millimeters annually, scientists warn, caused by subsidence, which is where the ground collapses as sediments settle or when people over-extract groundwater. In New York City, sinking is also occurring due to the weight of buildings pushing on the ground.Up to 28,600 square miles of the Atlantic Coast are experiencing subsidence annually, impacting millions of people and destabilizing levees, roads, and airports.Elsewhere in the world, subsidence is posing severe risks. In Jakarta, Indonesia, subsidence rates reach nearly a foot a year, predicting dire future scenarios for coastal cities globally. Within the next three decades, 95% of North Jakarta could be underwater. The city is planning a giant seawall to hold back the ocean in response.Scientists say the key to averting a crisis like Indonesia’s is obtaining high-resolution data and then pairing it with groundwater data.Natalie Snider, scientist: “Subsidence is so spatially variable. Having the details of where groundwater extraction is really having an impact, and being able to then demonstrate that we need to change our management of that water, that reduces subsidence in the future.”

Title: John Williams Scraps Retiring
Details: Legendary composer John Williams is denying claims that he’s retiring, continuing his iconic career at the age of 91.Rumors of his retirement swirled in July 2022 when Williams hinted that his score to the fifth “Indiana Jones” film might be his last. After lead actor Harrison Ford announced it would be his final film, Williams told The Associated Press: “I thought: If Harrison can do it, then perhaps I can, also.”In a new interview, however, Williams said “everything is possible” and that he likes to “keep an open mind.”Williams: “I don’t care much for grand pronunciamentos, statements that are firm and finished and surrounded by closed doors. If I made one without putting it in context then I withdraw it. If a film came along that I was greatly interested in, with a schedule that I could cope with, then I wouldn’t want to rule anything out. Everything is possible. All is before us. Only our limitations are holding us back. Or, to put it more simply: I like to keep an open mind.”
