Title: Startup Aims To ‘Make Tech Fun Again’
Details: A tech startup in London wants to rejuvenate the tech industry, arguing that designers have “forgotten new ideas” after the iPhone came out.The startup, called Nothing, was founded three years ago and has released three wireless earbuds and two smartphones, with a third set to launch next month. The design aesthetic has a retro-futuristic element, with the phones utilizing a monochromatic operating system designed in-house and a transparent back that displays the inner components. Above all, the company has a stated aim to “make tech fun again.”Adam Bates, the design director, says consumers have gotten “bored” with the newest tech products, as they all have a resemblance to the iPhone. Bates’ products thus seek to break away from the sleek slab aesthetic of most smartphones.Bates: “The iPhone in 2007 was a new format. There were touchscreen phones before but the way they designed the interface—really we're still with that now. Maybe in that process of trying to get there, people forgot about thinking of new ideas, and then also customers maybe stopped wanting new ideas. I guess for us to try and break out of it, we've got to trust ourselves as people that are interested in technology, that are creative, that care about the products that we use.”Among the company’s investors are iPod designer Tony Fadell and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.
