Title: Fast Food Quietly Employing Robots
Details: A startup called Aniai has raised $12 million to build a burger-grilling robot, investing the money into its first manufacturing facility in South Korea. The innovation comes amid estimates that restaurants could replace more than 80% of positions with robots, with the technology saving anywhere from 30% to 70% of labor costs.Ania’s flagship product, Alpha Grill, is a burger-grilling robot equipped with a cloud-based AI software platform called “Alpha Cloud.” It can cook 200 patties per hour.“Burger chains hire six to eight kitchen staff per shift to grill burgers,” Aniai CEO Gunpil Hwang said. “Alpha Grill enables restaurants to engage only one staff member to grill burgers.”Strikingly, Hwang said the grill already has 500 pre-orders for delivery starting in the first quarter of 2024. Other companies in this space include Miso Robotics, which is behind Flippy, a burger-flipping robot; Botinkit, a cooking robot maker in China; and Chef Robotics in San Francisco.

Title: Bros Scam USPS Out Of Millions
Details: Two brothers from California have admitted to a scam that cost the U.S. Postal Service over $2.3 million in fraudulent insurance claims. Their nearly three-year scam involved claiming compensation for 22,300 parcels, falsely reported as undelivered.Using fake recipient details, they claimed $100 in insurance for each parcel, asserting the contents were lost or damaged, despite the packages being empty or worthless.The investigation by the USPS Office of Inspector General led to the uncovering of this extensive fraud. The brothers used aliases and fake business names to file claims, complicating the tracing process.Sentencing is set for November, with each brother facing up to 20 years in federal prison.

Title: Women Claim Sex With Ghosts
Details: Men now have to compete with ghosts, with several women claiming their spiritual affairs were more fulfilling. This isn’t anything new, to be clear—there have been legends of spirits having sex with humans in Christian, Greek, Jewish, and Celtic folklore.Sian Jameson, a 25-year-old writer from North London: “He knew instinctively what I wanted and I didn't have to say or do anything. He was very handsome, with beautiful hazel eyes and, as we made love, he stroked my body tenderly and I could feel the weight of him pressing down on me. His body felt incredibly light.”She continued: “The whole encounter lasted an hour and afterwards he whispered: ‘That was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced.’ As we drifted off to sleep in one another’s arms, a voice in my head kept asking: ‘Is this really happening?’ Some people look at me as if I've gone mad. I’m in a relationship with a living man who thinks my past experience was just a dream and finds it funny.”Amethyst Realm, spiritual guidance consultant: “My boyfriend was away and I saw a heart drawn on the condensation in the window of the guest room. As I peered closer, I felt someone come up behind me, put their hands on my hips and breathe softly on my neck. It wasn't warm or cold, just a soft breath, but it felt lovely… it felt real.”Christopher French, professor of psychology, says that “what is generally accepted is that hallucinatory experiences are much more common in the non-clinical, totally well-functioning part of the population than was once appreciated.”

Title: Scientists Want To Revive Dodo Bird
Details: Over 350 years after extinction, efforts are underway to bring back the dodo bird, with scientists using advanced stem cell and genome editing technologies. This ambitious project involves creating a modern approximation of the dodo, a species famously wiped out by human activity.The initiative, costing over $225 million, also aims to revive other extinct species like the wooly mammoth and Tasmanian tiger.Scientists have sequenced the dodo’s genome from bone specimens and plan to use gene editing on the Nicobar pigeon's skin cells, the dodo's closest living relative, to replicate the extinct bird’s DNA as closely as possible.

Title: Teen Lives In Log Cabin, No Wi-Fi
Details: A teenager from California craved a sense of freedom, so she moved back to her childhood log cabin in Alaska. The residence, lacking modern amenities such as running water, heat, or Wi-Fi, offers a unique living experience in nature, 19-year-old Karma says.Born in California but raised in Alaska until age eight, Karma returned to the cabin at 18, drawn by memories and a desire for a simpler life. Despite harsh conditions, including temperatures dropping to -40C, she embraces the lifestyle, snowboarding in her “endless garden.”The cabin, owned by her father’s godfather, costs her only $275 per month in rent. Although Karma loves her current life, she doesn't see it as permanent, planning to attend med school in the future.Karma Wilcox: “The insulation is not the best, the logs are cut down and layered around the cabin with moss with sticks nailed in between to keep some warmth in. My main source of heating is firewood which is on 24/7 and I go through about a box of logs a day. When it snows, I go snowboarding pretty much every day which is so fun and I'm very lucky to have an endless garden around the cabin.”

Title: UK Urges Schools To Ban Phones
Details: The UK has issued new guidelines for banning mobile phones in schools, aiming to enhance learning environments by reducing distractions. This move follows similar actions by France and Italy, focusing on the well-being of students.Several options for implementing the ban include a complete prohibition on school premises, requiring students to hand in their phones upon arrival, storing phones in lockers, or keeping them turned off in bags.The move aims to reduce the negative impacts of social media on mental clarity and improve student concentration, activity levels, and face-to-face interaction among peers. Parents are encouraged to communicate with their children through school channels rather than personal phones.UK’s secretary of state for education: “This is about achieving clarity and consistency in practice, backing headteachers and leaders and giving staff confidence to act... By prohibiting mobile phones, schools can create safe and calm environments free from distraction so all pupils can receive the education they deserve.”

Title: Tap Water Linked To Ovarian Aging
Details: A new study finds that metals commonly found in drinking water, air pollution, and food contamination are linked to earlier aging of ovaries.The condition, known as diminished ovarian reserve, is associated with health issues like hot flashes, bone weakness, and heart disease. Heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead were found to accelerate this process, resulting in lower egg count in women approaching menopause.Researcher: “Metals, including arsenic and cadmium, possess endocrine disrupting characteristics and may be potentially toxic to the ovaries. We need to study the younger population as well to fully understand the role of chemicals in diminished ovarian reserve and infertility.”

Title: Education Makes You Live Longer
Details: A comprehensive study has found a direct link between education and increased life expectancy. The research, drawing on data from industrialized and developing countries, shows that each year of full-time education reduces an adult's mortality risk by 2%.Completing primary, secondary, and tertiary education can lower the risk of death by 34% compared to those with no formal education. This benefit is akin to a lifetime of healthy eating. Conversely, not attending school at any point is as detrimental to adult health as heavy drinking or smoking.Neil Davies, a professor of medical statistics at University College London, praised the study as “an impressive piece of work.”“It’s worth noting that the increased rates of absence from school have major consequences beyond their effect on health,” he emphasized.

Title: Japan Launching Wooden Satellite
Details: Japanese scientists are pioneering the use of wood in space technology with the world’s first wooden satellite, set to launch this summer. This innovative satellite is made from Magnolia wood and is designed to test wood’s durability in space, as well as combat space pollution.Traditional satellites burn up and release harmful particles that can damage the ozone layer. In contrast, wooden satellites would leave behind only biodegradable ash.The wooden satellite will operate for about six months in orbit, conducting experiments, including significant temperature fluctuations. Preliminary tests have shown promising results, with wood samples maintaining their integrity after a year in space aboard the ISS.Koji Murata, project head: “Wood's ability to withstand these conditions astounded us.”
