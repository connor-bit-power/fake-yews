Title: Strangers Can Detect Your Aura
Details: A new study reveals strangers can accurately assess someone’s life satisfaction and positive emotions after a mere brief interaction.The research involved 200 college students being photographed and videotaped during self-introductions. Strangers were asked to evaluate the students’ well-being based on these short introductions.Significant correlations were found between self-reported life satisfaction, positive affect, and evaluations made by strangers. Interestingly, key cues of happiness included a loud voice and physical attractiveness.

Title: Reality Show Seeks Adult Virgins
Details: A British channel is seeking adult virgins, including those who “identify as virgins,” for a new reality series that aims to help them overcome sexual fears.“The Intimacy Retreat” is open to individuals 21 and older. If selected, they’ll be “guided in the art of intimacy on a Mediterranean island retreat.” Sexologists will take a “radical and entirely new approach” to help participants “overcome their fears and insecurities when it comes to intimacy and sex.”Channel 4 said it is creating the series as “young people feel less attached,” noting that one in eight 26-year-old Brits are still virgins, which used to be one in 20.The channel encouraged people who have social anxiety, body image issues, and those who may have exited a “religious group” to apply. “We aim to handle all conversations in a sensitive and non-judgmental way,” the network said on its site.

Title: Man Uses Bed Sheets To Escape Jail
Details: A notorious mafia boss in Italy was captured after escaping from a maximum-security prison using bed sheets.Marco Raduano’s escape in February 2023 was widely shared online, showing him scaling down prison walls with knotted sheets. Described as “dangerous” by Europol, the leader of Italy’s Fourth Mafia was serving a 24-year sentence for crimes including drug trafficking and membership in a criminal organization.The Fourth Mafia, less known than other Italian crime syndicates, is considered Italy’s most violent, engaging in drug trafficking, extortions, and armed robberies among other criminal activities.This capture, along with the arrest of Gianluigi Troiano, Raduano’s “right-hand man” in Spain, is a significant blow against organized crime, as stated by Italian officials.

Title: Spain Prepares For World Without Rain
Details: Catalonia, Spain’s economic powerhouse, is investing $2.6 billion to combat drought. The region, home to the popular tourist city Barcelona, is adapting to a new climate reality.The investment focuses on desalination plants, a response to the increased likelihood of droughts due to global warming. Desalination is a process that removes salt from seawater, making it suitable for human consumption and irrigation.This strategic move comes as Catalonia faces a potential state of emergency due to water scarcity. The region’s dependency on rainwater is becoming unsustainable, and the plan aims to ensure water security by 2030. Desalination is a key part of this strategy, helping to reduce reliance on unpredictable rainfall.The region’s approach could serve as a model for other areas facing similar issues.

Title: Stay-At-Home GF Is Now Hip
Details: Videos of women promoting a lifestyle called “stay-at-home girlfriend” have racked up millions of views on TikTok, with critics saying it’s a step back for women.One content creator, Stella Williams, posts videos talking about having her rent, beauty treatments, and travel expenses covered by her boyfriend, reducing her stress significantly. She says it’s allowed her to focus more on her health and building her brand of making travel content.Williams: “Before this, I was in survival mode, trying to figure out how I was going to keep a roof over my head. Now I can completely focus on my health and lean into building my brand. There's an understanding between me and my partner that I just need to feel taken care of so I can serve in the ways that I want to serve in life.”Keen-eyed analysts note that this trend is a lukewarm version of the “tradwife” phenomenon, which has also grown on TikTok, promoting women providing domestic support such as cooking and cleaning.

Title: Popular Foods Are All ‘Pre-Digested’
Details: New reports reveal ultra-processed foods undergo a “pre-digestion” process, making them less filling and more addictive. This technique is akin to breaking down food to its molecular level, and then reassembling it with additives.A virology expert: “It’s an illusion of food. But it’s really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them in molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want.”The European Starch Industry Association: “The bulk of what is extracted is starch slurry, a milky mixture of starch and water, but we also have extracted proteins and fibers. Roughly half of the starch slurry goes to produce starch-based sugars and other derivatives. Those are created by hydrolysis, a process similar to human digestion.”This method is not only cost-effective for food manufacturers but also allows them to create a wide variety of products from a basic set of ingredients. Critics argue that such foods could have detrimental effects on health.

Title: AI Needs Sleep Like Humans
Details: Researchers have discovered that AI can better retain what it learns by mimicking human sleep and experiencing “dreams.”This new training method, called wake-sleep consolidated learning (WSCL), imitates how human brains transfer short-term memories to long-term ones during sleep. In WSCL, AI models are trained in an “awake” phase with data, followed by a “sleeping” phase where they review a mix of new and old data, enhancing their ability to retain information.Crucially, WSCL also has a period of “dreaming,” when the AI consumes entirely new data made from mashing together previous concepts. For instance, the animal model might be fed abstract images showing combinations of giraffes crossed with fish, or lions crossed with elephants. This helps to merge previous paths of digital “neurons,” freeing up space for other concepts in the future. It also primes unused neurons with patterns to help them pick up new lessons more easily.Researcher: “The point is that, as you gather new knowledge, you just combine more complex patterns. You might combine panda, giraffe, and leopard, so you’ll create this very strange mythological figure, and that will force the model to learn more complex patterns that maybe in the future can be reused.”

Title: Amazon Sells $18K Houses
Details: Amid the worsening housing crisis in America, more people are turning to tiny homes as an affordable living option.One TikToker, Graim, bought a tiny home off Amazon for $32,475, placing it on his 13-acre land to avoid high rent/mortgage fees. He plans to create a tiny home community for rental income, offering homes for $750 to $800 per month. However, concerns about the livability of these “shed” tiny homes arise, with additional work potentially required for full-time living.All of them seem to include a finished home containing fixtures like a bathroom, flooring, windows, doors, and pre-set hook-ups for ventilation/heating/cooling arrangements.Graim: “You can get one as low as $18,000. I wanted to get one that I can try to make into a decent-sized space where I can get some residual income coming in monthly. The goal is to bring in over $800 a month. I think we’ll be able to do that easily with this.”

Title: Monkey Clan Conquers City
Details: A city in central Thailand saw tourists flee and shops close as a ferocious army of 3,500 monkeys invaded the town center.It’s unclear where they came from, but the aggressive behavior of the primates has reportedly only intensified since COVID. Monkeys in Thailand are now reproducing so rapidly that even sterilization efforts have failed.“The monkeys are hungrier and more aggressive than before,” one woefully lamented. “With the tourists gone, they’ve been more aggressive, fighting humans for food to survive. They take anything they can. The comb, the mirror. If I leave the food unattended they steal the food as well.”Locals have had to go so far as to fortify their homes. “We live in a cage but the monkeys live outside,” one stated.
