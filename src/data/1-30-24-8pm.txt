Title: ‘Olympics On Drugs’ Gets Big Funding
Details: The Enhanced Games, known as the “Olympics on drugs,” has received significant financial backing from investors, including PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel. The first competition is set for December.Athletes in these games can use any drugs, with events spanning athletics, aquatics, gymnastics, strength, and combat. The creator, British businessman Aron D’Souza, believes this will break records and attract new fans, saying some athletes have already expressed interest. Critics, including athletes and anti-doping agencies, condemn the idea as dangerous.D’Souza: “This is the route towards eternal life. And what is performance medicine about? It’s not about steroids and getting jacked muscles. It’s about being a better, stronger, faster, younger athlete for longer. And who doesn’t want to be younger for longer.”“I want to see a 40, 50, 60-year-old break world records. Wouldn’t that be amazing? And as soon as we break the 100m world record, the mile world record, who’s going to want to watch the old, slow Olympics? Is NBC going to pay billions of dollars to broadcast a slow sporting event? Are cities going to invest billions of dollars to host a slow sporting event? They’re not going to,” he added.

Title: Law Would Let Deepfake Victims Sue
Details: A new bill in the U.S. is being introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, aiming to give victims of sexually explicit deepfake images legal recourse. Deepfakes use AI to create original fake imagery, “undress” real photos, and “face-swap” people into pornographic videos.The act would enable victims to sue those involved in creating and distributing such images, classifying the material as “digital forgery” and establishing a ten-year statute of limitations for taking legal action.It comes in response to the increasing online presence of deepfake content, often featuring various celebrities.Democrat Senator Dick Durbin: “Although the imagery may be fake, the harm to the victims from the distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes is very real. Victims have lost their jobs, and may suffer ongoing depression or anxiety.”Republican Senator Josh Hawley: “Nobody, neither celebrities nor ordinary Americans, should ever have to find themselves featured in AI pornography.”

Title: Syphilis Numbers Highest Since 1950s
Details: The U.S. is experiencing a significant rise in cases of STD syphilis, with a 9% increase in 2022, marking the highest count since 1950. This increase has affected over 207,000 people.The disease, which can lead to severe health issues like paralysis and dementia if untreated, is drawing increased focus from the CDC due to its impact on newborns and various communities.Interestingly, there has been an unexpected 9% decrease in new gonorrhea cases, the first decline in a decade, with the reasons behind this drop still unclear.

Title: AI Can Now Sleep And Dream
Details: Researchers have discovered that AI can better retain what it learns by mimicking human sleep and experiencing “dreams.”This new training method, called wake-sleep consolidated learning (WSCL), imitates how human brains transfer short-term memories to long-term ones during sleep. In WSCL, AI models are trained in an “awake” phase with data, followed by a “sleeping” phase where they review a mix of new and old data, enhancing their ability to retain information.Crucially, WSCL also has a period of “dreaming,” when the AI consumes entirely new data made from mashing together previous concepts. For instance, the animal model might be fed abstract images showing combinations of giraffes crossed with fish, or lions crossed with elephants. This helps to merge previous paths of digital “neurons,” freeing up space for other concepts in the future. It also primes unused neurons with patterns to help them pick up new lessons more easily.Researcher: “The point is that, as you gather new knowledge, you just combine more complex patterns. You might combine panda, giraffe, and leopard, so you’ll create this very strange mythological figure, and that will force the model to learn more complex patterns that maybe in the future can be reused.”

Title: FDA: Penis Stretchers Don’t Work
Details: The FDA has issued a warning to Dr. Joel Kaplan Inc. for making unapproved claims about its penis enlargement products.The company advertised a penis pump that claimed to increase “length and thickness,” a penis extender to “reverse shrinkage,” and a “clitoral enhancement system” to enhance “sensitivity and sensation.”The FDA’s warning letter accuses the company of illegal advertising for claiming these products can treat various conditions without their approval. Dr. Joel Kaplan Inc. responded with frustration, citing efforts to comply with regulations, but some claims remain on their website.The global market for erectile dysfunction devices, including penis pumps and implants, reached $1.7 billion in revenue in 2023 and continues to grow.

Title: Canada Delays Expanding Euthanasia
Details: Canada has postponed plans to expand its Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) to include those suffering only from “mental illnesses.” The delay is due to there not being enough healthcare professionals, particularly psychiatrists, to adequately assess these cases.Currently, MAiD allows people with incurable illnesses to choose euthanasia, with about 13,000 Canadians utilizing the program in 2022. The program’s expansion to include “mental illness” patients has raised concerns, as critics fear it could lead to impulsive decisions by individuals in distress.Mark Holland, Canada’s minister of health: “The system needs to be ready, and we need to get it right. It's clear from the conversations we've had that the system is not ready, and we need more time. Although the curriculum is present, although the guidelines are set, there has not been enough time for people to be trained on them, and provinces and territories are saying their systems are not ready and need more time.”Canada has ranked among the world’s euthanasia hotspots, with 7% of all deaths in Quebec being from lethal injections.

Title: Lil Pump Has Trump Tattoo On Thigh
Details: Lil Pump revealed today that he has a large tattoo of Trump’s mugshot on his thigh. He posted a series of photos to his Instagram, with the caption: “MAGA.”Pump has been vocal about his support for Trump, endorsing him in previous elections.

Title: Robot Crashes Into Car, Flees Scene
Details: In Finland, a food delivery robot had a minor collision with a parked car. After a passerby witnessed the incident and moved the violator back onto the street, the robot quickly fled the scene.Good Samaritan: “I notified the emergency center about a ‘traffic accident.’ The businesslike but amused emergency operator said he would notify the police. The police called, asked for identification, and said that this incident was a career-first.”

Title: Hydro Flask Calls Out Stanley Bottles
Details: Hydro Flask has issued a statement following reports of lead in the increasingly popular Stanley bottles.The company posted on Instagram: “For over a decade, Hydro Flask has NOT had lead in our sealing process. In 2012, we pioneered a new process that sealed our bottles without the use of lead. We aim for a higher standard.”Stanley has acknowledged there is “some lead” in its sealing material but reassured customers “that no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product that comes into contact with the consumer nor the contents of the product.”

Title: Monkey Runs Away, Drones Deployed
Details: A monkey escaped from a zoo in Scotland, leading to thermal imaging drones being deployed. The primate was later spotted in a local village, sitting on a fence and eating nuts from a bird feeder.Residents have been advised to avoid keeping food outside and refrain from approaching the animal, though it is not considered dangerous.A resident who spotted the monkey: “I was woken by a telephone call by my daughter telling me there: ‘Dad, there's a monkey on your street.’ Apparently, a video had been posted on Facebook in a neighboring garden of the macaque and I thought, ‘What were the chances of it being in our garden?’ So I got up, went to my patio door, and there I was in my dressing gown with a primate in my garden.”
