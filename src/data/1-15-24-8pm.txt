Title: Study: Air Pollution Makes You Lazier
Details: A new study found that air pollution is making people lazier. Scientists in the UK claim pollution levels in their nation are causing an extra 22 minutes of inactivity per day.Rising levels of nitrogen dioxide, a common air pollutant, were linked to this increase in sedentary behavior.The study involved 644 individuals, using accelerometers to track their activity over three years. Researchers defined inactivity as time spent lying down, sitting, reclining, or standing without moving.Dr. Jonathan Goldney: “This could encourage more time spent indoors and less time being active outside, creating a vicious cycle that increases the risk of chronic diseases. If air pollution is indeed driving this rise in inactivity, measures like low emission zones could significantly impact individual sedentary behaviors and have a profound effect on public health.”This isn’t the only surprising byproduct of air pollution. Researchers earlier this month concluded that pollutants adversely affect male fertility, impacting basic sperm parameters such as sperm concentration, sperm motility, morphology, and semen volume.

Title: DeSantis, Haley Fight For Second
Details: As YEWS called it ten hours ago, Donald Trump has won the Iowa caucus. Currently, he’s at 50.9%, with 84% of the votes in. What analysts are watching now is who will come in second, with Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley neck-and-neck. The New York Times estimates a greater than 95% chance that DeSantis will come out on top.As of publication, DeSantis has 21.2% and Haley has 19.3%. Vivek Ramaswamy, whom many hoped could emerge as the dark horse in the Republican primary, has 7.7%.Haley is a favorite of Wall Street, with major players like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin speaking positively about her. The contest between her and DeSantis has been over who will be the Republican challenger to Trump and unify the “Never Trump” GOP base.

Title: Solar Farms Can Impact Weather
Details: New research suggests that extremely large solar farms could significantly impact the weather, absorbing so much heat that global climate patterns would be rearranged.The study used a computer program to model the Earth system and simulate how enormous solar farms covering 20% of the Sahara would affect solar power generation around the world. It found that when millions of solar panels are grouped, rainfall would be shifted away from the tropics and lead to the desert becoming greener again, much as it was just 5,000 years ago.This would in turn affect how much solar energy could be generated around the world. Some regions, such as the Middle East and the U.S. Southwest, would be less able to generate solar power, while others, like Central and South America, would generate more solar.The study emphasizes the need for international collaboration in planning large-scale solar projects, underscoring how much influence they could have on the world.

Title: OnlyFans Star Arrested For Espionage
Details: A 36-year-old OnlyFans model was arrested in Poland on suspicion of spying for Belarus’ dictator. Daria Ostapenko allegedly collaborated with Belarus' KGB secret service for up to seven years.Ostapenko is accused of posing as a pro-democracy opposition activist while secretly informing the KGB on democracy campaigners who have fled abroad, including to Poland. She worked as an OnlyFans model as a cover, Polish prosecutors allege.The arrest occurred after Ostapenko, reportedly under the influence of alcohol, revealed her true role to friends. Evidence of her links to the KGB was found on her smartphone, leading to her detention. She faces charges under Poland's espionage laws, with penalties ranging from five to 30 years in prison.

Title: Customers Turn On Self-Checkout
Details: Retailers and consumers increasingly find self-checkout kiosks more burdensome than beneficial. The technology, aimed at reducing costs and improving convenience and speed for customers, often leads to long lines and requires staff intervention for errors or age-restricted item checks.Despite initial adoption, companies like Walmart and UK's Booths are reducing their reliance on self-checkout due to theft concerns and unreliability. Dollar General is planning to increase staff at checkout areas, reversing their earlier self-checkout-centric approach.In a 2021 survey of 1,000 American shoppers, 60% of consumers said they prefer to use self-checkout over a staffed checkout aisle when given the choice, yet 67% of consumers have had the technology fail while trying to use it.Christopher Andrews, Associate Professor and Chair of Sociology at Drew University: “It hasn't delivered anything that it promises. Stores saw this as the next frontier… If they could get the consumer to think that [self-checkout] was a preferable way to shop, then they could cut labor costs. But they're finding that people need help doing it, or that they'll steal stuff. They ended up realizing that they're not saving money, they're losing money.”Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General, said during his company's Q3 earnings call last month: “We had relied and started to rely too much this year on self-checkout in our stores. We should be using self-checkout as a secondary checkout vehicle, not a primary.”

Title: Night Mode Found To Be Over-Hyped
Details: New research challenges previous assumptions about blue light affecting sleep. Earlier studies, mainly on mice, suggested that blue light significantly impacts sleep quality and the internal clock. As a result, many apps, including even Apple’s iOS, have released “night modes,” which darken the screen.A new study involving 16 volunteers exposed to different light colors found that light color variation along a blue-yellow spectrum does not significantly affect the human internal clock or sleep quality. The finding directly contrasts with the earlier studies on mice.Dr. Christine Blume: “We found no evidence that the variation of light color along a blue-yellow dimension plays a relevant role for the human internal clock or sleep. Rather, our results support the findings of many other studies that the light-sensitive ganglion cells are most important for the human internal clock.”

Title: Tesla Robot Folds Laundry
Details: Elon Musk posted a video on X showcasing Tesla's Optimus robot folding a shirt. The robots are described as “humanoid, general purpose, bi-pedal” and are capable of performing tasks that are “unsafe, repetitive or boring.”In the video, the Tesla Optimus is seen carefully removing a T-shirt from a laundry basket and folding it on a table, proving the robot's precision and learning capabilities in handling delicate tasks.In September 2023, X posted: “Optimus can now sort objects autonomously. Its neural network is trained fully end-to-end: video in, controls out.”

Title: IMF: AI Impacting 60% Of U.S. Jobs
Details: The International Monetary Fund warns in a new analysis that AI could affect 60% of jobs in the U.S., worsening income and wealth inequality. Advanced economies are particularly at risk due to their focus on cognitive task-oriented jobs.The analysis emphasizes that AI could replace more than half the jobs available in advanced economies like Canada, the UK, Japan, Germany, France, and Italy. In emerging economies, 40% of jobs are likely to be impacted, and 26% in low-income countries.Importantly, AI's displacement risks extend to higher-wage earners, not just middle-skilled workers. “Automation…had the strongest effect on middle-skilled workers, [but] AI displacement risks extend to higher-wage earners,” the analysis said.Advancements in generative AI were top of the concerns for most CEOs in a new poll, with almost 75% predicting it would significantly change their business in the next three years. Last April, Goldman Sachs warned generative AI could impact as many as 300 million full-time jobs globally. A month later, AI was blamed for nearly 4,000 Americans losing their jobs.On a “positive” note, Goldman Sachs notes generative AI could boost GDP by up to 7% due to increased productivity.

Title: Apple Watch Loses Key Feature
Details: Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 are set to lose their blood oxygen monitoring feature following a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The decision comes after the International Trade Commission ruled that Apple infringed on Masimo's patents.Both models were initially banned in the U.S. in late 2023 but resumed sales after Apple filed an appeal and won a temporary pause on the ban. Apple has since worked on changes to avoid Masimo's patents but agreed to drop the feature.U.S. Customs and Border Protection approved the removal of the blood oxygen feature, allowing Apple to continue selling these models. Modified watches have already been shipped to Apple retail stores, but the stores have been instructed not to sell the modified watches until they receive word from corporate.Matt Whewell, director of Global Communications at Masimo: “Apple’s claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability.”

Title: Exam Boredom Affecting Student Grades
Details: Researchers have found that boredom in exams significantly affects student performance. This is the first study to closely examine boredom in exam environments, involving 1,820 German students from 5th to 10th grade.The study revealed that high levels of boredom were more likely when the exam lacked personal relevance to the students. This boredom was also linked to a negative effect on exam results.The “abundance” hypothesis proposed by the researchers suggests that boredom arises when students are over-challenged (the test is too hard) or under-challenged (the test is too easy). Over-challenging leads to lower grades due to cognitive resource consumption.Educational psychologist Thomas Götz: “In order to combat test boredom, teachers should prepare exam tasks in such a way that they relate to the reality of students' lives and are not very under-challenging or over-challenging.”
