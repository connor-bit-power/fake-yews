Title: Mickey Mouse Enters Public Domain
Details: Early versions of Mickey and Minnie Mouse are now part of the public domain, allowing free use and reinterpretation by artists and creators.The reason for this is copyright law: U.S. law allows copyright to be held for 95 years, after which it enters the public domain. Modern versions of the iconic character will remain unaffected.People can now creatively reuse the Mickey Mouse from “Steamboat Willie.” Examples include incorporating clips in an art project or selling a T-shirt reproducing a frame. But if those items infringe on the overall trademark of Mickey Mouse, Disney can still sue.Jennifer Jenkins, director of the Duke Center for the Study of the Public Domain: “This is a big one. It’s generating so much excitement in the copyright community—it’s finally happening.”Lawrence Lessig, Harvard law professor: “Let’s hope it’s the opening of a new chapter. The biggest weakness in copyright is that we have no way to know who owns what. It’s the most inefficient property system known to man.”

Title: Important Vultures News
Details: According to the West Kentucky Star, black vultures are still causing problems in western Kentucky, local agriculture agents say.The University of Kentucky reports that the large birds have increased in number steadily over the past 20 years, to the point where swells of them are common over most of Kentucky and the eastern U.S.Experts emphasize that black vultures are different from the traditional turkey vultures. The latter, distinguished by their featherless red head, feed exclusively on the carcasses of dead animals. The more aggressive black vultures pose a problem as they attack living small animals, including farm animals.These vultures are federally protected, meaning it’s illegal to kill them, disturb their eggs, or destroy their nests.

Title: Powerful Earthquake, Waves Hit Japan
Details: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake has hit Japan on the first day of 2024, sending tsunami waves along the country’s west coast.Within 90 minutes, 21 quakes above 4.0 magnitude occurred, leaving thousands homeless or without power. Videos of the devastating aftermath quickly made the rounds on social media, showing evacuations, fires, destroyed homes, and collapsed buildings.A tsunami threat was also announced in eastern Russian cities, without any evacuations reported yet.

Title: Gen Alpha Is Gen Z On Steroids
Details: Generation Alpha, born between 2010-2024, is considered the first fully online generation and is expected to exceed two billion people, making it the largest generation in history.Known as “iPad kids,” they have grown up with advanced technology, like the iPhone and TikTok, as a norm. COVID significantly shaped their upbringing, leading to increased online learning and socializing. Access to tools like ChatGPT AI and Siri at a young age has only intensified their reliance on technology for education.MaryLeigh Bliss, chief content officer at YPulse: “They're having a media-centric childhood in a way that is different because of the kinds of media they're interacting with from incredibly young ages.”Others are optimistic. Mark McCrindle, a social researcher, says, “Alphas bring a sense of empathy because they are connected globally to the issues of their world.”Millennial parents give kids their first smartphones at about nine years old, researchers have found. 79% of these parents say their children are on social media, and 44% note their kids watch video content on a smartphone at least weekly. Nearly half (43%) of the parents also say their children have had a virtual playdate or hung out with friends in virtual spaces.

Title: The Wealthiest Are Leaving California
Details: California is seeing a significant exodus of its high-earning and well-educated populace, The Los Angeles Times notes, reversing a long-standing trend.For years, thousands of individuals in this demographic have been leaving rather than arriving, drawn away by lower taxes and a more affordable cost of living in other states.In 2021 and 2022, about 750,000 more people left the state than moved in, according to new released Census Bureau data. In that time, more than 250,000 Californians with at least a bachelor’s degree moved out, while an average of 175,000 college graduates from other states settled in California, according to an analysis of the data.In prior decades, that balance was about even or slightly in California’s favor.As a result, the state is struggling with a record $68 billion deficit due to a 25% drop in personal income tax collection last year. There are other factors driving this, such as a slow stock market and layoffs in the tech sector, but the increasing emigration of professionals is certainly causing an impact.The migration pattern is particularly strong among those aged 35 to 44, largely driven by California's severe housing affordability crisis. The median price of a single-family house in the state was $840,360 in October, up 46% since early 2020.Joel Kotkin, fellow at Chapman University: “There’s a price to pay for the movement of middle- and upper-income people and corporations. People who are leaving are taking their tax dollars with them.”

Title: Israel Expects War To Last All Year
Details: The war in Gaza is not expected to wrap up any time soon, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said yesterday.Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that the Israeli military is making adjustments to its deployment of troops in the Gaza Strip as it anticipates the war lasting for the entirety of 2024.Hagari: “We are adjusting the fighting methods to each area in Gaza, as well as the necessary forces to carry out the mission in the best way possible. Each area has different characteristics and different operational needs.”The official added that as 2024 begins, “The goal of the war requires lengthy fighting, and we are prepared accordingly.”The conflict, nearing three months, has resulted in at least 21,822 deaths in Gaza and 1,200 in Israel. Hamas media claims 8,000 Palestinian children have been murdered by Israeli troops.

Title: Saudi Arabia’s Rise Stuns World
Details: Led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia saw a dramatic rise in global influence in 2023, largely spurred by control over the oil market, diplomatic power, and investments in avenues like entertainment and futuristic cities.Back in 2020, the desert kingdom faced global isolation. Biden called Mohammed bin Salman a “pariah” for the death of an American journalist, while the EU urged an arms embargo on the nation.Since then, the kingdom has used its influence over oil to rise beyond expectations. “Saudi Arabia's centrality in the world oil market is the centerpiece of Saudi global influence,” said international relations professor F. Gregory Gause.The country has also leveraged its location in the Middle East in diplomatic strategies. The Crown Prince’s efforts include negotiations, brokered by the U.S., to normalize relations with Israel, and an easing of tensions with Iran.Guided by his Vision 2030, Mohammed bin Salman ultimately seeks to move his nation away from a reliance on fossil fuels to become a global leader in technology and innovation. In November, the country was named the host of the 2030 World Expo, beating Italy and South Korea. This global exhibition will attract billions in investment and thousands of visitors to the desert kingdom.Saudi Arabia has also invested billions in PGA golf, hosted heavyweight boxing tournaments, and continued construction of its futuristic megacity Neom, which will include a man-made mountain and be 17 times the size of London.

Title: Mr & Mrs Ye Win Best Scandal
Details: Ye and Bianca have secured first place on The Daily Mail’s ranking of the biggest celebrity scandals of 2023, thanks to what the paper is calling their “Italian job.”Of course, The Mail is referring to the romantic boat trip the pair had in Venice—a moment journalists seized on because they themselves are lonely and lack any semblance of an intimate connection.It’s a fitting end to another year plagued by blunders and boobishness from the media, because, as YEWS can now confirm to readers, Ye & B weren’t caught in flagrante delicto at all. The story was simply made up by malicious journalists.

Title: Analyst: Big Firms Collapsing In 2024
Details: 2024 will see a rise in failures for big firms amid high borrowing costs and pressure on consumer budgets, analysts say.Construction and business services saw the highest insolvency rates in 2023, signaling continued vulnerability. Hospitality and retail were also heavily impacted by rising energy costs and borrowing expenses.David Kelly, head of insolvency, PwC: “We are expecting these areas to remain the hardest hit in 2024.”High-growth companies, particularly in the tech sector, may face significant challenges as funding dries up.Rob Hornby, partner, AlixPartners: “We are expecting next year to be a big year for insolvency. That is likely to be across the board, both in terms of geographies and sectors. I personally think we are definitely seeing an element of the dotcom bubble repeating itself. Since before the pandemic, there was plenty of investment money around, with venture capitalists worried about missing out. You ended up with some areas of tech, for example, where you had more competitors funded in one space than were ever likely to succeed sustainably in the longer term. Now some of that funding is running dry, you will start to see consequences.”

Title: ‘Exercise Pills’ Are On The Horizon
Details: Scientists are exploring “exercise mimetics,” drugs or injections that replicate some of the benefits of exercise.A landmark experiment in Norway is testing the effects of injecting exercised plasma into older adults with early-stage Alzheimer’s. The hormone irisin, released during exercise, shows promise in clearing toxic plaques in the brain related to Alzheimer’s.The main target for these drugs is disabled and elderly patients, but they may also benefit the general population on busy days.Researchers are moving slowly and cautiously because of the risk of unpleasant or even dangerous side-effects that have intercepted various previous attempts to turn exercise into a drug.Andrew Budson, professor of neurology at Boston University: “I think there’s nothing inherently wrong with the idea of trying to replicate the physiologically beneficial effects of exercise. I have no problem with that. I happen to enjoy my exercise and I don’t think that I would give it up, but on a busy day, I think it would be great to [be able to] take a drug instead of missing out on the health benefits of exercise completely.”
