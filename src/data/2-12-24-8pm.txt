Title: Self-Driving Car Set On Fire
Details: A crowd in San Francisco attacked a self-driving car over the weekend, with some hitting the vehicle with a skateboard and eventually setting it on fire. The incident is the latest in a years-long trend of people lashing out at driverless vehicles.The attack comes amid controversy over self-driving cars in the city, following an incident last week where a Waymo vehicle struck a cyclist, causing minor injuries and sparking a regulatory review. Other incidents have raised safety concerns, including a case where a woman was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise driverless vehicle.In 2018, police in Arizona recorded 21 incidents where people attacked Waymo self-driving cars. It’s likely this latest incident in San Francisco won’t be the last.

Title: Valentine’s Day Backlash Grows
Details: More and more people appear to be rejecting Valentine’s Day, reflected in a growing demand for anti-Valentine’s merchandise. Nail designs are an especially popular product, with some having tiny middle fingers and hearts slashed by a “no” sign.Etsy reports that searches for this kind of merch increased by 14% this year compared to last and that anti-Valentine’s Day T-shirts are 34% more popular than in 2023.Interestingly, this coincides with a growing trend of couples saying they aren’t having enough sex. According to a new poll, one in seven Americans in serious relationships say their partner doesn’t do enough to show that they desire them, and nearly one in five people admit that being physically intimate with their partner has been a low or non-existent priority over the past year. Stress was the most common reason given.

Title: Bezos Saving $600M In Miami Move
Details: Jeff Bezos will save over $600 million in taxes by moving to Florida, which has no state income tax or a tax on capital gains. He plans to sell 50 million shares of Amazon by January 2025, which would be subject to a 7% capital gains tax in his former residence of Washington.The move to Miami was initially explained as allowing Bezos to be closer to his parents and Blue Origin rocket launches, but financial incentives were certainly a plus. The Amazon founder’s relocation saved him $140 million on the stock sale last week alone.Bezos has also invested in Miami real estate, purchasing two mansions for $147 million and planning a new estate likely exceeding $200 million in costs.

Title: College Students Struggling To Read
Details: Professors across the U.S. have noticed a trend over the past five years of college students struggling to read. COVID has only made it worse.“For most of my career, I assigned around 30 pages of reading per class meeting as a baseline expectation,” one professor at Illinois' North Central College, whose classes largely include humanities and philosophy instruction, wrote. “Now students are intimidated by anything over ten pages and seem to walk away from readings of as little as 20 pages with no real understanding.”Other professors have written articles voicing similar concerns, pointing to factors like the prevalence of smartphones as the primary reading medium and the “teach-to-test” style that has for decades dominated education.“Not only did the marked decline in reading resilience start before the pandemic, but the students I am seeing would have already been in high school during the school closures,” the Illinois professor said. “Hence they would be better equipped to get something out of the online format and, more importantly, their basic reading competence would have already been established.”

Title: Man-Made Private Island Sails World
Details: A man-made private island yacht, modeled after the luxurious city of Monaco, is set to feature a racing track, helipad, pools, and a mini-submarine. This ambitious concept design, named “The Streets of Monaco,” aims to recreate the iconic elements of Monaco’s cityscape and Formula-1 racing circuit.The yacht’s design includes replicas of notable Monaco landmarks, such as the Hotel de Paris, complete with a grand prix circuit that can hold three karts side by side. It also features an oasis with a waterfall and cascading pools at its center, inspired by the gardens of the Monaco Casino.Inside, the yacht offers seven guest suites, each with its private bathroom, reception room, dressing room, bedroom, and balcony. The owner’s suite, spanning three floors and over 15,000 square feet, includes a personal Jacuzzi and swimming pool with a private sundeck.The concept envisions a beach deck for parking smaller boats and jet skis, enhancing the illusion of being in a real city, despite floor-to-ceiling windows revealing the open ocean.

Title: Water Engineered From Thin Air
Details: Amid severe droughts in Las Vegas, innovative technology is turning air into drinking water using solar-powered hydropanels. This modern technique is rooted in ancient practices, such as fog nets in Peru, dating back to the 1500s.Cody Friesen, an associate professor at Arizona State University, founded Source Global, creating hydropanels that absorb water vapor from the air when exposed to sunlight, even in extremely dry conditions like Scottsdale, Arizona. These panels are cost-effective and efficient, designed to produce four to five liters of water per panel per day, with the potential to increase output with advancements in AI and machine learning.Source Global’s mission extends beyond profit, aiming to democratize water access for communities without reliable sources, including rural and tribal areas and regions struck by natural disasters.The technology, which has reached over 50 countries, could be a sustainable solution to global water scarcity, potentially even for future missions to Mars.

Title: Young People Have More Heart Problems
Details: Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., but there’s been a concerning rise in heart attacks among younger adults aged 20 to 50.Several lifestyle choices, often established in childhood, contribute to this increase, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and the use of substances.COVID has also played a role in exacerbating heart disease, particularly through its inflammatory effects on the body, which can lead to blood clots and heart attacks. This has been especially noted in the age group of 25 to 44.The American Heart Association emphasizes prevention with “Life’s Essential 8”: a healthy diet, no tobacco, regular exercise, sufficient sleep, weight management, monitoring cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Regular check-ins with a healthcare provider are recommended to manage these risk factors effectively.

Title: Princess Poses For Playboy

Title: 200-Foot Tower Randomly Disappears
Details: Thieves stole a 200-foot radio tower from an Alabama radio station last week in a bold overnight operation, leaving station staff and the local community baffled. The station, on air since the 1950s, has now been forced to shut down as authorities continue to investigate the mystery.Brett Elmore, the general manager of WJLX, was stunned upon discovering the tower’s disappearance, unheard of in his 26-year career in radio. The culprits managed to dismantle the steel structure by cutting its securing wires and also took other equipment from the site.Brett Elmore: “It’s a matter of safety. If something [significant] happened, listeners tune in and we won’t be there. With our station down, the community has lost its sound and lost its voice.”

Title: Remixing Suburbs Could Fix Housing
Details: An architecture researcher from Australia has proposed a new way to engineer suburbs, which he says would address housing shortages by offering more affordable, socially connected living options in suburban areas.Damian Madigan’s approach, called “bluefield housing,” involves modifying existing homes to support multiple dwellings on a single block, preserving green spaces. A house in this model is described as being somewhere between single-family homes and unit developments, but unlike most unit developments, the houses are not fenced off from each other.According to Madigan, this model could double or triple homes on lots without disrupting neighborhood aesthetics, providing smaller, more affordable housing options in established suburbs. “It's become increasingly clear in recent years that the established suburbs will have to play their part in supporting an increase in housing supply, affordability and choice,” he says.The housing crisis has been felt across the West, thanks to economic trends like rising interest rates. In the U.S., housing is the least affordable it’s been in four decades.
