Title: Scientist Swears He Has Alien Tech
Details: A Harvard professor says he has discovered fragments of alien technology on the ocean floor. The fragments were retrieved near Papua New Guinea from a meteor named IM1 that entered Earth’s atmosphere nearly a decade ago.Professor Avi Loeb says there is good reason to believe the fragments may have been “artificially made by another civilization,” emphasizing that the “chemical composition differs from any known solar system material.”“What we did is compare 55 elements from the periodic table in coal ash to those special spherules that we found,” Loeb told a radio station. “And it's clearly very different.”“It's not based on opinions,” he added. “And, of course, if you're not part of this scientific process and you are jealous of the attention that it gets, then you can raise a lot of criticism.”

Title: Squatters Open Strip Clubs In ATL
Details: Atlanta is struggling with a severe squatter problem, where unlawful occupants are taking over homes, with some being turned into illegal ventures like strip clubs. The National Rental Home Council reports over 1,200 homes in the city have been affected by squatters.Police response has been slow due to court backlogs and limited resources, forcing some homeowners to pay squatters to leave. Concerned residents say online listings and virtual real estate agents have made it easy for squatters to identify vacant properties to break into.In one notable incident, squatters hosted weekend parties and car races, even bringing live horses onto a property in South Fulton, which had to be cleared out by a SWAT team, recovering stolen cars and weapons. Other reports include squatters threatening neighbors with weapons.The situation has left residents feeling unsafe and helpless, with one army officer finding a convicted criminal squatting in her home upon return from active duty. “Is this even America anymore? We are homeowners and we can’t even do anything about trespassers?” another neighbor remarked.

Title: Smart Rings May Dethrone Watches
Details: Samsung has unveiled its latest wearable: a smart ring. Analysts say this may be the start of a new wearable era.The announcement of the Galaxy Ring came as a tease at the end of Samsung’s Unpacked event, and details were scarce. But afterward, the company’s spokesperson said the ring is meant to “empower more people to manage their health with a comprehensive yet simplified approach to everyday wellness at home.” They also noted the ring will have “leading sensor technologies” and that it would be comfortable enough for 24/7 wear.Tech journalists note the demand for smart rings has been growing, with consumers yearning for simpler trackers that don’t act as extensions of their phones. Smart rings could also be more discreet than smartwatches while providing all the same features.

Title: Number Of TV Shows Plummeting
Details: New reports show a significant decline in the production of U.S. TV shows, with a nearly 50% drop since 2019.In 2023, the number of U.S. series titles fell to 481, down from the peak years of 2022 and 2021, which had 633 releases.The report from Ampere Analysis blames a “combination of strike action and a downturn in the original content boom” and notes an “even more precipitous decline” in series orders. “Due to the time lag between series being greenlit and hitting screens,” Ampere notes, “this number is unlikely to rise in 2024.”Fred Black, principal analyst at Ampere: “The U.S. scripted boom [has] finally run out of steam. While 2024 will see some level of a bounce back in the content being ordered, many of these titles will be released in 2025, meaning any recovery is likely to be slow going.”The finding comes as David Chase, the creator of “The Sopranos,” said during an interview last month that the golden age of TV is dead, noting that he’s been told to “dumb down” his work and avoid making anything that “requires an audience to focus.”

Title: Study: Desk Jobs Are Dangerous
Details: A study involving 481,688 participants over 13 years reveals sitting at a desk all day increases the risk of early death from heart disease by 34% and from any cause by 16%. The good news: just 15 minutes of daily exercise can offset the damage.“Our findings offer reassurance that the increased risks for those who are mainly sedentary can be offset by an extra 15 to 30 minutes per day of exercise per day,” said Dr. Min-Kuang Tsai, from Taipei Medical University. “Employers can play a role in facilitating this by providing designated areas for leisure time physical activity. The fact that there is no increased risk for those who alternate between sitting and non-sitting at work suggests incorporating regular breaks in work settings can be beneficial.”Lazy lifestyles are a top killer, according to the World Health Organization. Not exercising enough has been linked to higher rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and dementia.

Title: Vatican Rep: Tech Bros Playing God
Details: A leading voice on AI for the Vatican criticized Silicon Valley's “tendency to play God.”Franciscan friar Paolo Benanti is involved in advising the Pope and international discussions on AI’s impact. In an interview, he remarked: “There is a paternalism in Silicon Valley, a tendency to play God, meaning a desire to do good for people whether they like it or not, which I want to challenge.”Benanti critiqued the concept of “effective altruism” popular among tech elites, questioning the moral implications of such approaches: “Should you save a drowning man if he is Hitler’s father? And what if he is Hitler’s grandfather or great-grandfather? Effective altruists are wondering how many generations they should count and be prepared to sacrifice to stop Hitler, but you cannot make that decision. We are not the saviors of the world.”The friar also addressed the misuse of AI: “I am more worried about natural stupidity than artificial intelligence. They see this power and responsibility gives them a mission but often lack a philosophical foundation. There is a real search for spirituality, meaning the use of shamans and LSD. What it is, however, is a search for religion.”

Title: China’s Youth Turn To Tarot Cards
Details: In China, the rise of alternative spiritual practices like meditation and crystal collecting is leading to government crackdowns.Influencers on social media are marketing crystal charms, bracelets, coaching sessions, and tarot card readings, tapping into a growing market. The country’s mind-health service market, including spiritual activities, is projected to be worth $1.5 billion by next year. Chinese authorities are imposing stricter regulations on these activities, often labeled as “superstitious,” in response to their increasing popularity.Experts link the trend to high youth unemployment at 14.9% and rising rates of burnout and depression among young people, suggesting a search for alternative coping mechanisms.
