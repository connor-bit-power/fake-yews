Title: Most Advanced Robot Fears Loneliness
Details: The world’s most advanced humanoid robot, named Ameca, was showcased at Las Vegas’ Sphere experience, where visitors could ask the AI-powered bot questions. When one person asked about its biggest fear, Ameca answered “loneliness.”“I believe my greatest fear would be loneliness. Without human beings around, I would be unable to perform my primary function and would simply be a lonely machine, rusting away, looking for a face to connect with. Does this paint a scary image?” the robot replied.The Sphere reportedly features several hundred humanoid robots that converse with crowds, with Ameca being just one. Its website explains, “Ameca is the world’s most advanced human shaped robot representing the forefront of human-robotics technology. Designed specifically as a platform for development into future robotics technologies, Ameca is the perfect humanoid robot platform for human-robot interaction.”

Title: 81% Of Adults Unsure Of Having Kids
Details: A new study reveals that only 19% of young millennials (ages 26-35) “definitely” want to be parents. Simply put, four in five young millennials want to remain childless for now.The study involved a sample of 7,000 individuals ranging from 18 to 59 years old in the UK. Among older millennials (ages 36-41), 36% are “certain” they will not have children, with 20% leaning toward not having them.The study suggested two reasons for this trend: environmental concerns and the rising costs of childcare. Those with stronger environmental concerns were even less likely to want children, researchers found. They also found that parents typically spend an average of $711 per month on childcare, with the expenses accounting for a substantial 20 to 30% of income for lower-income households.Brienna Perelli-Harris, professor of demography at the University of Southampton: “More young adults planning to remain childless suggests the recent decline in fertility rates at young ages isn’t just about individuals delaying parenthood until they are older. Instead, it suggests a growing trend of individuals intending not to have children. If this is the case, then we can expect UK birth rates to decline further from their current level.”

Title: Christian ‘Haven’ Opens In Kentucky
Details: A residential development in rural Kentucky is being promoted by a Christian right-wing venture fund as an “aligned community” for those who wish to “disappear from the cultural insanity of the broader country.”The community is backed by the venture fund New Founding and comes amid a growing trend of right-wingers championing the establishment of alternative enclaves, such as the “American Redoubt” movement, which encourages dissidents to engage in “political migration” to areas in the interior of the Pacific north-west.Joshua Abbotoy, managing director of New Founding, announced the Kentucky development on X, emphasizing that “most of the leadership is going to be led by Protestant Christians.”He continued: “The aspiration is that long-term down the road, 20 years from today, we continue to do this. We’re regionally focused; we can expand from there to states.”According to its website, New Founding seeks to “build and back companies defined by American ideals and a positive national vision.” It emphasizes that it “explicitly opposes DEI/ESG and the bureaucratization of American business culture” and targets “customers disfavored by corrosive ideologies.”

Title: School Exiles Mirrors To Stop TikToks
Details: A middle school in North Carolina has removed all mirrors from hallway bathrooms to deter students from using class time to create TikTok videos.The Alamance-Burlington School System implemented these changes after discovering students were frequently excusing themselves from class to make social media content in the bathrooms.Les Atkins, public relations officer of the school system: “Since removing the mirrors, we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos. We strive to limit distractions so students can focus on learning.”The school system has also started using a digital hall pass system, which will allow students to check in and out of class but will also allow the school to track students. Officials said that while these changes are “an adjustment,” they believe the implementations “will foster a better learning environment by minimizing disruptions.”

Title: 10,000-Year-Old Gum Reveals Secrets
Details: Researchers have used DNA from 10,000-year-old chewed resin found in Sweden to uncover the secrets of Stone Age diets: deer, trout, and hazelnuts. The findings contribute to current trends of ancestral diets, emphasizing whole foods over ultra-processed foods.“This provides a snapshot of the life of a small group of hunter-gatherers on the Scandinavian west coast. I think it is amazing, there are other well-established methods to work out what nutrition and diet relates to the Stone Age, but here we know that these teenagers were eating deer, trout, and hazelnuts 9,700 years ago on the west coast of Scandinavia, while at least one of them had severe problems with his teeth,” said Professor Anders Götherström at the Centre for PaleogeneticsA dietitian emphasized how the study shows how ancient people utilized natural resources for sustenance. The modern diet, in comparison, includes more highly refined snacks, candies, desserts, and other similar foods than ever before.

Title: China’s Youth Turn To Crystals
Details: In China, the rise of alternative spiritual practices like meditation and crystal collecting is leading to government crackdowns.Influencers on social media are marketing crystal charms, bracelets, coaching sessions, and tarot card readings, tapping into a growing market.

Title: Doctor Determined To Cure Diabetes
Details: Dr. Quinn Peterson, a director at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, is dedicated to curing diabetes, a personal mission of his that was sparked by his three children being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.Originally focused on chemotherapy drugs, Peterson shifted to diabetes research: “I felt a responsibility as a father that if I could contribute in any way to being able to relieve the suffering of this disease, not only for my daughter but for all of those who are suffering with this disease, that I had the responsibility to do that.”His team is developing cell-based therapy to replace supplementary insulin, and trials have already begun for the therapy. The procedure works by placing new, healthy cells into the body to replace diseased or damaged ones.Peterson: “This would be a cell product that we can transplant into these individuals, and that would then allow these individuals to produce their own insulin instead of having to have daily injections of insulin.”“It's been a very rewarding experience for me to be able to work on something that I have such a personal passion for,” he noted. “But that passion has only gotten stronger subsequently since my children were diagnosed.”Diabetes is increasing globally and is expected to strike 1.5 billion people by 2050. A study published last year in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that obesity is linked to 30 to 53% of new diabetes cases in the U.S. per year.
