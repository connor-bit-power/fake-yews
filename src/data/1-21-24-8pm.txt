Title: Oakland’s Only In-N-Out Closes
Details: The only In-N-Out location in Oakland, California, is set to close on March 24 after more than 18 years of operation. Despite being “busy and profitable,” the decision to close has been confirmed by Denny Warnick, the burger restaurant’s chief operating officer, citing “ongoing issues with crime.”Warnick: “Despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our Customers and Associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies. Our top priority must be the safety and well-being of our Customers and Associates—we cannot ask them to visit or work in an unsafe environment.”Warnick acknowledged the impact of the closure, saying, “I recognize that this closure negatively impacts our associates and their families,” and assured that all affected employees would have the opportunity to transfer to nearby In-N-Out locations.Security guards reported more theft reports at this In-N-Out than at any other location they patrol, seeing as many as five break-ins there per day. It’s unclear if the bandits ever ran into each other.

Title: Chandler Jones: ‘CTE Is Not Real’
Details: Former NFL player Chandler Jones expressed skepticism about the existence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) in a new interview, suggesting he may join forces with Antonio Brown to put an end to the hypothesis once and for all.Jones, on the Jaxxon Podcast: “Going into your conversation of the CTE thing—I think it's funny. Me and Antonio Brown were actually going to run a podcast called 'CTE Podcast' because they're saying we both have CTE. So I don't know the other two words in the acronym CTE but I know the 'T' stands for trauma.”“I know it's not blunt force trauma. It doesn't also mean you got hit in the head too many times—that doesn't mean that. CTE is not real, I don't believe it's real,” he added.Jones is currently a free agent, having played for Arizona and Las Vegas before being released by the Raiders last September.According to a study done by Boston University last year, nearly 92% of former NFL players were diagnosed with CTE in a pool of 376 players.

Title: Voters Tuning Out Of 2024 Election
Details: Americans are paying less attention to this primary election season than the past two, suggesting voters have already concluded that Biden and Trump will face off again and everything beforehand is a waste of time.Compared to 2016 and 2020, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News all reported lower audience numbers for this year’s Iowa caucus. Fox especially fell short, drawing 4.4 million in 2020 but less than 2.8 million this year. In comparison, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Philadelphia Eagles game that the same night drew 28.62 million viewers.While voters are expecting a Biden-Trump rematch, polls have found they’re not exactly thrilled. An Associated Press survey from last December revealed that 56% of adults would be very or somewhat dissatisfied with Biden as the Democrat nominee, while 58% of adults said they would be very or somewhat dissatisfied with Trump as the Republican nominee.

Title: Putin, Jong Un Vow ‘New World Order’
Details: Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin have vowed to form a “New World Order,” uniting against the West. The two leaders have agreed on further strategic and tactical cooperation to establish a “new multi-polarized international order,” according to North Korea’s Foreign Ministry.Officials from both countries have expressed “serious concern” over the U.S. expanding its military cooperation with Asian allies, blaming it for increasing regional tensions and threatening North Korea’s sovereignty and security interests.Kim Jong Un sees the alliance as a move to break out of diplomatic isolation, as he faces a nuclear stalemate with the U.S., Seoul, and Tokyo. North Korea has been one of the few nations to openly support Russia's war on Ukraine.In a major press conference last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared an end to Western “global domination,” stressing the emergence of new economic, financial, and political powers surpassing Western nations.The Baltic states have reacted to the perceived threat by strengthening their defenses. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all NATO and EU members, have agreed to construct bunkers on their borders with Russia and Belarus.

Title: Holograms Bringing Back Dead Scholars
Details: British universities are set to introduce holographic technology to beam in lecturers both living and dead. This innovative approach aims to enhance the learning experience by making classes more engaging and interactive.Students could see their next physics class taught by Albert Einstein, for instance. “Students absolutely love the technology and have been begging for selfies with the gadget. They would prefer a guest speaker from industry beaming into a classroom to a 2D person on the wall,” said Professor Vikki Locke of Loughborough Business School.David Nussbaum, founder of Proto, the company providing the holographic technology: “Proto has the technology to project an image of Stephen Hawking, or anybody, and make it look like he’s really there. We can hook it up to books, lectures, social media—anything he was attached to, any question, any interaction with him. It’s awe-inspiring, it’s jaw-dropping, I’ve been in shock at how amazing the interactions are. AI is part of our life, whether people like it or not.” He added that his firm’s ambition was to prove “you shouldn’t have to be an eccentric millionaire or a celebrity to have a hologram.”Proto plans to introduce smaller, affordable holographic units within the next 18 months, expanding the technology's accessibility and potential applications beyond large institutions.

Title: Most Americans Think Journalists Lie
Details: A new survey by Gallup reveals that both Democrats and Republicans have record-low trust in journalists. Overall, fewer than one in five Americans now perceive journalists as highly honest and ethical.Democrats have especially lost faith, with 54% of them in 2018 viewing journalists as having “high” or “very high” honesty and ethical standards, compared to just 34% as of last year.Interestingly, Republicans have shown a slight increase in their faith in reporters, rising to 8% last year from 5% in 2020. However, this is still a decrease from the peak of 19% in 2015.

Title: U.S. Home Sales Hit 30-Year Low
Details: U.S. home sales have plunged to their lowest level in nearly 30 years, with only 4.09 million homes purchased in 2023, marking the fewest since 1995.The National Association of Realtors (NAR) attributed this sharp decline to rising interest rates, which increased costs for buyers and dissuaded potential sellers who already had lower rates from selling. Despite the challenging market conditions, the NAR expects some improvement in 2024 but warns that affordability remains a concern.Median sale prices in 2023 climbed 1% to $389,800, a significant jump of more than 40% since 2019, highlighting the intense price surge during the pandemic.Lawrence Yun, an economist at the NAR, said the recent price rises were “unsustainable” and that boosting supply to create a path toward homeownership for renters was “essential.” “If price increases continue at the current pace, the country could accelerate into haves and have-nots,” he grimly concluded.

Title: ‘Psychedelic Churches’ Are Spreading
Details: So-called “psychedelic churches” are spreading across the U.S., fueled by a global trend for drug-induced therapy praised by Prince Harry.It’s estimated that between 200 and 2,000 of these locations exist in the country, from states with liberal drug laws such as California and Oregon to resolutely conservative ones including Utah and Alabama. Most are informal, underground networks, but some have public profiles and charge membership fees in exchange for drugs. They tend to use Airbnbs in remote areas to avoid scrutiny, but some occupy permanent buildings in the mode of traditional churches.Stars such as Will Smith, Aaron Rodgers, and Prince Harry have celebrated using the drugs to attain a spiritual connection. One practitioner remarked, “It was only when I did Ayahuasca that I finally felt like I connected with God. And when you connect with God, it's so fucking real. Like, it's just so big. And you're like, ‘Oh my God,’ and you know, it's God. You're not like, ‘What is that?’ It's like, this is God.”

Title: NASA Unlocks $1B Asteroid Canister
Details: NASA has successfully opened a canister containing asteroid dust after spending $1 billion to bring back the sample and four months of tinkering.The canister parachuted down through the Earth’s atmosphere into the Utah desert in September, but the dust from the asteroid, Bennu, was first collected in 2020 by a NASA mission. For months, the team struggled with the last two of 35 fasteners before finally dislodging them.NASA announced on social media, “It’s open! It’s open!” sharing a photograph of the dust and small rocks inside the canister. Scientists used custom tools made from surgical, non-magnetic stainless steel to open it without contaminating the samples.Ashley King of London’s Natural History Museum emphasized the significance of these samples: “These are some of the oldest materials formed in our solar system. Samples from asteroids [such as this] tell us what all those ingredients were for making a planet like the Earth and they also tell us what the recipe was.”The billion-dollar spacecraft that collected the sample is now heading toward another asteroid, while scientists analyze the nine-ounce sample from Bennu to gain insights into the solar system's early days.

Title: Six-Legged Spaniel Now Lives On Four
Details: A Spaniel born with six legs and found abandoned in a car park in Wales has undergone successful surgery to remove her extra limbs.The surgery was performed at an animal hospital in England, transforming Ariel into a normal dog with four paws. The extra legs, which were non-functional, extended from her right hindquarters and resembled a flipper, leading to her being named after the Disney character Ariel from “The Little Mermaid.”Before the operation, Ariel walked awkwardly due to the additional appendage, but she is now recovering well and has been discharged from the hospital.One commenter questioned the procedure: “We all know that four legs are better than two, then surely 6 is perfect?”
